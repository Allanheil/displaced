D - Hah, you finally came.
D - How do you like my work? 
Ro(talk) - This is terrible. Why would you do this?
D - Don't be so boring.
D - When else would you be able to see something so different to your insipid lives?
Ar(neutral) - Pardon my insipidness, but we're going to stop you.
D - Hahaha, that's a funny joke. 
D - You fight for this world, but it's a lost cause.
D - I really like your persistence, but look at yourself.
D - You guys are the only ones who actually came. 
Ar(neutral) - But it was you, who made locals indifferent to their future. 
D - Bullshit. It's just your nature. 
D - To be cattle for us. 
Ar(anger) - Getting really sick of your arrogance.
D - Great, entertain me little moths!
