FA - Oh shit, the queen fell!
FB - Run!
The other faeries quickly scattered away.
FQ - Ggh, you fuckers... 
Ar - You have one nasty mouth. We need something of yours.
Ro - Saint's Pearl. Ring a bell?
FQ - Hah, what makes you think I'll hand over anything at all to you?
Em - Because we are the good guys?
FQ - Even less of a reason for me.
Er - She won't bend, let's just strip her.
FQ - What the hell are you thinking, you crazy bimbo?!
Ar - That seems a bit extreme...
(if seens Rose scene faery_queen_1_a) {
Ro(sarcastic) - Yeah, go for it, Erika. 
Ro(sarcastic) - Make her pay for what I went through.
Ar(neutral) - Huh? Has something happened?
Ro - N-no, it's nothing.
}
Er - No, if we humiliate her in front of others she will lose her authority.
Em(normal) - Ho-oh, so that's why people wear clothes? 
Ar - Still seems a bit dirty, but if there's nothing else we can do...
FQ - No, stay away you imbecile perverts!

Er - There it is. 
Erika held up a small white gem acquired from Faery Queen.
Ri - Let me see it... I can't sense any magic from it.
Ro(shock) - No way, all this for nothing? 
Ar(neutral) - Well, we might find some use for it in future. Let's go home for now.
Er - Good call, I'm already sick of this forest.
