Ro - I've finished asking around.
Ro - It seems there's no known info about Avior, or where it even might be. 
Ar - You made sure not to give away where we came from, right? 
Ro - Yes. Thankfully, there's plenty of adventurers passing by around here, often anonymously. 
Ro - Anyway, these lands are called Vienar. 
Ar(neutral) - Never heard of such a name. 
Ro - Me neither. 
Ro - Most of civilization seems to be run by independent city-states, who seem to trade and share frequently, but most oppose each other on some political level. 
Ro - But, our village lies somewhat distant from most other cities, hence why there's little interest in this place.
Ar - So... that means we can stay here safely?
Ro - That also means we have no idea how to get back.
Ro(sarcastic) - Wait, master, are you actually planning to return? 
Ar - Hm... Maybe.
Ro(talk) - What!? We can't stay here for the rest of our lives. 
Ar - Why not?
Ro(sarcastic) - Aren’t you going to miss your family? Your royal life?
Ar - Well, I have to get revenge on Norb, don't I.
Ar - Relax, I'm just kidding. I guess our only option to get back is how we got here. We’re gonna need some skilled mages. 
Ro - That already might prove to be a challenge. From what passing adventurers said, teleportation magic doesn’t seem to be common around here.
Ar - Well, all the more reason to make sure our position here is nice and stable.
Ar - Plus when else am I going to get the chance to rule anyone but mere servants?
