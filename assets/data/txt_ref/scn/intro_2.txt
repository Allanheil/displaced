After days worth of walking, and losing hope, Arron and Rose come across a small, poor settlement. & EV_INTRO_2_0
Ro(shock) - Look, Master, a goblin village! & EV_INTRO_2_1
Ar(neutral) - Looks more like a dunghole to me. & EV_INTRO_2_2
Ro - We haven't seen any people for 2 days... Let's check it out at least. & EV_INTRO_2_3
Ar(neutral) - Fine, whatever. & EV_INTRO_2_4
Arron calls for the attention of a single goblin who does not seem surprised by his appearance. & EV_INTRO_2_5

Ar(neutral) - Hey you, what is this place?  & EV_INTRO_2_6
G - What does it look like to you? We live here. & EV_INTRO_2_7
Ro - This place does not look very comfortable to live in. But where is it located? Maybe you can show us on a map? If you have one around? & EV_INTRO_2_8
G - Do I look like I ever went anywhere else? And whatâ€™s a map?  & EV_INTRO_2_9
Ro - ... & EV_INTRO_2_10
Ar(neutral) - Yet, you don't look very surprised by us.  & EV_INTRO_2_11
G - Freaking big deal. Adventurers come and go all the time. Some even stay and leech off our food. & EV_INTRO_2_12
Ar - Curious, and whose domain is this?  & EV_INTRO_2_13
G - Eh? We don't belong to anyone since nobody really cares about this land.  & EV_INTRO_2_14
G - This place might look like a dump, but it's totally independent.  & EV_INTRO_2_15
Ar(shock) - What? Who governs you then? You don't even have a leader? & EV_INTRO_2_16
G - No. I told just you that... & EV_INTRO_2_17
Hearing that Arron's eyes quickly shine with fervor. & EV_INTRO_2_18
Ar - You heard it? These savages need a governor! & EV_INTRO_2_19
Ro(sarcastic) - With all respect, I don't think you will be able to lead... & EV_INTRO_2_20
Ar - Tell me, friend, do you know the benefits of having someone to organize and take care of town's problems? & EV_INTRO_2_21

A few days later & EV_INTRO_2_22

After becoming the settlement's mayor, Arron and Rose moved into the best available house. & EV_INTRO_2_23
Ar - See that? And they were saying democracy is a mistake. & EV_INTRO_2_24
Ro(sarcastic) - (Makes me realize why) & EV_INTRO_2_25
Ro(talk) - I must say, this is a rather nice living space. & EV_INTRO_2_26
Ro(talk) - Oh, and we also have our first visitor today. & EV_INTRO_2_27
Ar - People want to meet their new leader. Let's not keep them waiting. Bring them in. & EV_INTRO_2_28
A shabby looking goblin casually walks in, disinterestedly looking around. & EV_INTRO_2_29

G - Oi, Governor, since you are responsible for the village now, Flak from market asks you to visit him. & EV_INTRO_2_30
Ar(neutral) - (No manners at all, huh) & EV_INTRO_2_31
Ar(neutral) - Why did he not visit himself? & EV_INTRO_2_32
G - He is busy, I guess. Just don't take too long. & EV_INTRO_2_33

The goblin disappears, leaving Arron mildly baffled.  & EV_INTRO_2_34
Ar(neutral) - You bring him here then.  & EV_INTRO_2_35
Ro(sarcastic) - I'm afraid he won't agree to follow me. We can't order them around just like that.  & EV_INTRO_2_36
Ar(neutral) - ... & EV_INTRO_2_37
Ar(neutral) - Democracy was a mistake. & EV_INTRO_2_38
