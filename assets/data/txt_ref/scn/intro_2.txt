After days worth of walking, and losing hope, Arron and Rose come across a small, poor settlement.
Ro(shock) - Look, Master, a goblin village!
Ar(neutral) - Looks more like a dunghole to me.
Ro - We haven't seen any people for 2 days... Let's check it out at least.
Ar(neutral) - Fine, whatever.
Arron calls for the attention of a single goblin who does not seem surprised by his appearance.

Ar(neutral) - Hey you, what is this place? 
G - What does it look like to you? We live here.
Ro - This place does not look very comfortable to live in. But where is it located? Maybe you can show us on a map? If you have one around?
G - Do I look like I ever went anywhere else? And whatâ€™s a map? 
Ro - ...
Ar(neutral) - Yet, you don't look very surprised by us. 
G - Freaking big deal. Adventurers come and go all the time. Some even stay and leech off our food.
Ar - Curious, and whose domain is this? 
G - Eh? We don't belong to anyone since nobody really cares about this land. 
G - This place might look like a dump, but it's totally independent. 
Ar(shock) - What? Who governs you then? You don't even have a leader?
G - No. I told just you that...
Hearing that Arron's eyes quickly shine with fervor.
Ar - You heard it? These savages need a governor!
Ro(sarcastic) - With all respect, I don't think you will be able to lead...
Ar - Tell me, friend, do you know the benefits of having someone to organize and take care of town's problems?

After becoming the settlement's mayor, Arron and Rose moved into the best available house.
Ar - See that? And they were saying democracy is a mistake.
Ro(sarcastic) - (Makes me realize why)
Ro(talk) - I must say, this is a rather nice living space.
Ro(talk) - Oh, and we also have our first visitor today.
Ar - People want to meet their new leader. Let's not keep them waiting. Bring them in.
A shabby looking goblin casually walks in, disinterestedly looking around.

=DELAY 0.5=
G - Oi, Governor, since you are responsible for the village now, Flak from market asks you to visit him.
Ar(neutral) - (No manners at all, huh)
Ar(neutral) - Why did he not visit himself?
G - He is busy, I guess. Just don't take too long.

The goblin disappears, leaving Arron mildly baffled. 
Ar(neutral) - You bring him here then. 
Ro(sarcastic) - I'm afraid he won't agree to follow me. We can't order them around just like that. 
Ar(neutral) - ...
Ar(neutral) - Democracy was a mistake.
