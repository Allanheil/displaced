Et - Enough slaughtering of my brethren! What do thou want, fleshling?  & EV_FOREST_2_0
Ro(shock) - Wow, it can talk. & EV_FOREST_2_1
Et - Hey, I demand thou doth not disrespect me! Addressing me as 'it' assumes thou doth not recognize my sentience.  & EV_FOREST_2_2
Et - I am several centuries old and am addressed as a male. & EV_FOREST_2_3
Ar - That's stupid, trees are hermaphrodites. Since when do you even have a society? & EV_FOREST_2_4
Et - Since we moved into this groove.  & EV_FOREST_2_5
Ar - Oh, yeah, about that, we were told there are elves here. Why are you here instead? & EV_FOREST_2_6
Et - Those elves, thou speak of, hardly live up to the nobility of the elves of my memory. & EV_FOREST_2_7
Et - We have made them our wards  and we peacefully coexist. & EV_FOREST_2_8
Ar - Huh... taken into custody by trees? How sad.  Whatever, we want them as well, might still be of some use to us.  & EV_FOREST_2_9
Et - Thou propose a trade agreement? Of course, we have elves to spare for you and others. Art thou willing to see them? & EV_FOREST_2_10
Ar - Sure, why not. & EV_FOREST_2_11
Et - *Groan* & EV_FOREST_2_12
Another huge treant slowly comes close. Its trunk bark bends to the sides, revealing a semi-conscious naked figure of an elven girl restricted inside of it. & EV_FOREST_2_13

Ar - What the hell?  & EV_FOREST_2_14
Et - This is the elf thou were looking for. & EV_FOREST_2_15
Ro - Why is she like that?! & EV_FOREST_2_16
Et - This way we protect them and they feed us with their fluids and energy. & EV_FOREST_2_17

As in demonstration, a thick vine moved through the tied elf's crotch. & EV_FOREST_2_18
Er - Mmmhm... & EV_FOREST_2_19
Ar - That's enough, you should release her. & EV_FOREST_2_20
Et - What? No. This is not correct... & EV_FOREST_2_21
Ar - Rose, pass me the torch. & EV_FOREST_2_22

In a few moments vines have released the girl's body, which fell into Arron's arms. & EV_FOREST_2_24
Er - Ugh... & EV_FOREST_2_25
Er - What's going on, Willy?  & EV_FOREST_2_26
Er - Who's this handsome man holding me?  & EV_FOREST_2_27
Et - You see, Erika, this is Arron. He wants to... talk to you. & EV_FOREST_2_28
Ar - Uh... are you alright? & EV_FOREST_2_29
Er - Just a bit sore, but thanks for worrying, hehe.  & EV_FOREST_2_30
Ro - Aren't you kept as hostage here...? & EV_FOREST_2_31
Er(happy) - Me? No, Willies are warm and comfy, and make me feel good! You should try it yourself. & EV_FOREST_2_32
Ro(sarcastic) - ... I will pass on that. & EV_FOREST_2_33
Ro - (I guess we were worried for nothing, but what even are these elves then?) & EV_FOREST_2_34
Et - Thou see now, our union is completely consensual. We even have papers... & EV_FOREST_2_35
Er - Boring talks again... what a waste of time. & EV_FOREST_2_36
Ar - Good to see you aren't snobbish at all, looks like we feared for nothing.  & EV_FOREST_2_37
Ro(talk) - Master! & EV_FOREST_2_38
Er(happy) - Oh thank you! You are rather pleasant yourself.  & EV_FOREST_2_39
Et - My apologies, dost thou want to go to slumber again?  & EV_FOREST_2_40
Er - Now that you mention it... Say Arron, right? & EV_FOREST_2_41
Er(happy) - I haven't seen anyone like you around here before. & EV_FOREST_2_42
Ar - I'm certainly a unique being.  & EV_FOREST_2_43
Erika moves closer to Arron, taking his hand and giving him a sultry look. & EV_FOREST_2_44
Er - Can I come along with you? I want to see what's going on in the world and ...to get to know you better. & EV_FOREST_2_45
Ro(sarcastic) - *Frown* & EV_FOREST_2_46
Ar - With pleasure. & EV_FOREST_2_47
Ro(shock) - Master! Could you at least consider it for a moment before accepting? & EV_FOREST_2_48
Er - Don't be so jealous, sweetheart. I'm not going to keep him to myself. & EV_FOREST_2_49
Er(happy) - In fact, I'd love to know you better as well *wink* ! & EV_FOREST_2_50
Ro(shock) - I refuse! & EV_FOREST_2_51
Er(happy) - Ha-ha-ha, youâ€™re so modest. That's cute!  & EV_FOREST_2_52
Ar - Alright, we can continue this on the way back, would you mind dressing up before we leave?  & EV_FOREST_2_53
Er - Sure thing honey, give me a moment! & EV_FOREST_2_54
Ar - Meanwhile, let's settle what we came here for. Hey, willow guy... & EV_FOREST_2_55

Er - Thanks for asking, but I don't like carrying around heavy stuff, so I've got all I need. & EV_FOREST_2_58
