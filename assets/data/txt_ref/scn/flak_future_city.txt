F - Hey, looks like you've made it.
F - I wanted to see you, but your gals didn't let me in. 
Ar - Fair, they didn't let me out either.
Ar - So what's been going on?
F - Not much, except for bloodthirsty monsters and demons roaming around.
F - Good thing they don't seem to care much about our village though.
F - And that huge dead town thing emerging on the east where you've come from last time.
F - Kinda feels like the world is coming to an end.
Ar - True... I should check this out before it's too late.
