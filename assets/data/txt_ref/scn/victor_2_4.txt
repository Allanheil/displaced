Defeated Victor fell on his knees not in any condition to continue the fight.
V - Ghhh... How... Can I lose...
V - After all... these years...
V - Defeated... by a bunch of kids...
Ar(neutral) - This is over, you bastard. 
Ar(neutral) - Ember. 
Em - ...*nod*
Ember steadily advanced to crouching man.
V - You think... I'm scared of you?... 
*Crack*
=SOUND hit=
Em - ...
Ember's fist struck into Victor's face.
As Victor's skull cracked, the blade fell from his hand.
Ar - That was an uninspired last line.
Ro - Wha... What's going on?
A blade from Victor's hand began shining as it was covered in cracks. 
After a loud explosion streams of energy began dissipating in all directions.
Ar - These are...
Ri(talk) - Dragons souls are being freed. 
Ri(talk) - He can't suppress them any longer inside of his sword.
Em - Ah... 
Er - Wow, that's quite a sight.
Ro - Look, something happens to Ember!
Being close to the streams, a shining essence has been drawn from Ember's hands.
=BG scenes/ember_dragon=
The essence near ember began to form into a dragon shape.
Em - Is this...
Em - M-mother?
DrJr - Yes. 
DrJr - This seems to be at an end.
DrJr - I'm proud of you, Ember. 
DrJr - Sorry, I was a terrible parent. 
Em - No.
Em - You were with me all this time. 
Em - And you gave birth to me.
DrJr - You've grown well.
Em - Thank you.
Em - What happens now?
DrJr - You have freed their souls.
DrJr - Now they can be reborn into a new hatchling. 
Em - So, we saved them?
DrJr - Yes, you've done a great deed.
DrJr - But it seems I'll have to go too. 
Em - ...
Em - Thanks for staying with me all this time. 
DrJr - Heh, I was sure you'd be crying here.
Em - Maybe we can meet again?
DrJr - After rebirth we will not remember who we were in previous life.
DrJr - But I'm glad you have found your place and friends you can rely on. 
DrJr - Arron. You are still to face great dangers, but I trust you to take care of my daughter. 
Ar - Hmm... I'm not sure I'm up to the responsibility yet. 
DrJr - Don't worry, I'm  sure you can make Ember some fine offspring with some practice.
Em - Eh?!
DrJr - After all I've almost had first-hand experience.
Ar - You had what?!
DrJr - Don't act so surprised now. 
DrJr - My daughter is too innocent to take initiative, so I gave her a couple of hints.
Ar - ...And took some liberty in the bedroom...?
DrJr - That was the best for all of us. 
DrJr - But it's time for me to go. 
DrJr - Good luck, children. 
With last words vanishing in the air so did the image of Ezet.

Ar - ...Look, it wasn't as lewd as you imagine. 
Ro - Disgusting.
Em - Ah, so that's why I acted like that.
Ri - ...
Er - Kinky.
I(sad) - Hmm I'm not sure how ancestors would feel about it.
Ar - Okay, enough. 
Ar - Let's get out of here, before someone sees us and blames us for murdering Aeros's hero.
