Ar - This is weird. We got the essence, but Iola hasn't come back since that day.
Ro - Maybe they let her pass without it?
Ar(neutral) - That would suck.
Ar - How do we get rewarded like this then?

Ri - She's actually in trouble. 
Ro(talk) - Eh?
Ar(neutral) - What do you mean?
Ri - She was captured and kept imprisoned.
Ar - But how do you know that?
Ri - I've planted a small spirit on her.
Ro(sarcastic) - Why?
Ri - So I can know her condition and location.
Ar - That's something new.
Ar - Do you do this often?
Ri - Don't worry, you won't notice it.
Ro(sarcastic) - .....
Ar(neutral) - Anyway, where's Iola? 
Ri - I assume it's her cult grounds.
Ri(talk) - We should go there to save her.
Ar - Huh, you seem... Kinda worried? 
Ar - What happened to the deadpan girl I knew?
Ri(talk) - I'm not deadpan.
Ro(talk) - You think we should go there? 
Ro - This might be quite dangerous.
Ar - Well, someone has to pay for the mission we've completed. 
Ar - In the worst case we can loot something from there.
Ro(sarcastic) - I sincerely hope you are joking this time.
