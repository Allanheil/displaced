F - Hey, big guy, there's some nasty news coming from Aeros.
Ar - Really? What about?
F - Dunno, something like a war?
F -  There seem to be many refugees coming from that direction.
F - Just thought you'd be interested to know about it.
Ar(neutral) - Doesn't seem good. I guess we should check it out.

The team has entered Aeros observing the surrounding disaster.
Ro(sad) - This looks horrible...
Surv - What are you doing here?!
Surv - You should escape with everyone now!
Ar(neutral) - What exactly is going on?
Surv - Monsters and demons attacked the city.
Surv - They have taken the city hall and now hunt every man in the vicinity.
Surv - Some guards still try to fight, but it's all meaningless.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm.. What about the city hall?
Surv - People say everyone there was killed. Monsters come from there as if there's a nest.
Ar - I guess that's our target then.
Surv - Whatever, if you die it's not my problem.
Ar(neutral) - Why don't you show some guts? It's your city after all.
Surv - You are a fool.
Surv - At times like these your only chance to survive is to watch out for yourself.

Demon - Raaargh!
Surv - S-Screw you, I'm out of here!
Ar(neutral) - No wonder the city is in ruins with residents like these.
