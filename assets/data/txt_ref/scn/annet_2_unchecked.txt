An - Gh, you degenerates...

A horde of large demons swarmed the hall from all directions.
Ar(shock) - Oh shit!
Ar(shock) - Stay together.
Ro(shock) - There's too many!
Em(sad) - Ngh...
An - How does it feel to be outnumbered now?
An - Ha-h, lets see how long you'll hold up.
An - But while we are at it...
I(sad) - This looks really bad, there's no end to them.
An - *Chanting*
An - (italic)Erika, return to my side.

Er(sad) - .....
Ro(talk) - Eh... Erika?
Ar(shock) - What are you doing?!
Er(sad) - I'm... sorry.
Ignoring the battle and enemies, Erika left the team and slowly walked into Annet's direction.
Ro(shock) - No way...
An - Hahah, you imbeciles!
An - Did you seriously think I'd leave my toy with no security measures?
Ro - You are the lowest.
Ro(talk) - Stop, Erika!
An - Don't waste your breath.
An - She was hypnotized long time ago to obey my will on command. 
Ri - We won't hold without her...
An - Your really don't know how to secure victory, Arron.
An - Never leave things to chance.

Whole room froze in awe as Erika stabbed Annet's neck.
An(anger) - Wha...t...
An(anger) - Why...
Er(anger) - You are right.
Er(anger) - Never leave things to chance.
Er(anger) - You really thought I would never find a way to resist your hypnosis? 
An(anger) - You... biiitch!.. 
Er(anger) - I've learned from the best.
An(anger) - Ghhh!..
*Slash*
=BG scenes/annet_erika_2=
An(anger) - Nnooo!..
A red splash erupted from Annet's neck as the dagger sliced it through.
Er(anger) - Go to hell, Mistress.

With Annet's defeat all demons in the hall quickly retreated from sight.
Er(anger) - Phew... 
Er(sad) - I'm shaking now.
Er - But somehow feel great.
Ar - Yeah, you've saved us.
Er - Turns out, I'm a pretty good actress, huh?
Ro - You really made us worried. 
Er - I've realized she'd always treat me as her victim.
Er - So I thought this would be a safer approach.
Ar - Well, looks like we saved a city at least.

De - Nice work, insects. 
Ar(anger) - Dimitrius!
De - Now, don't look so mad.
De - You've done me a great service today and I'll spare your lives for some time.
Ar(neutral) - You talk highly for someone who'll be gutted by the end of this.
De - Ahahah, nice one, Arron. 
De - You actually have no idea how troublesome it is to kill another demon lord with a big reputation in this world. 
De - But you actually did it.
Ro - You wanted her dead? That's why you didn't help her?
De - That's what I said. 
De - I actually thought about giving you a hand on one occasion, but you managed anyway.
Ri - You've left your kin here to die like that.
Ro - They don't think of their own any higher than of normal people.
Em(sad) - You really aren't afraid to lose?
De - What, do you really  think I should be worried about you?
De - You just don't understand, do you?
De - You are not a threat. You killed Annet, but she was weak and stupid. 
De - I can squash you all like bugs, but you never know when you might need a couple of resourceful mortals.
I - We'll stop you and end this madness.
De - Yeah, sure, struggle some more if you wish.
De - Have your little celebration, for today.
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Ar(neutral) - ....He's gone.
Ri - There seems to be a crowd outside.
Ro - Those are probably the survivors.

Surv - It was you? You defeated the demons?
Ar(neutral) - No, we just were really persuasive.
Surv - Eh? 
Ar(neutral) - Let's return to the village. 
Ro - Indeed, this was a tough day.
Surv - But what should we do? What if demons return?
Ar(neutral) - I'm afraid my charisma is too low to take you all.
Ar - You will have to figure out how to defend yourself eventually.
The team left puzzled civilians.
I(sad) - I wonder if we should've left them like this.
Ar(neutral) - It can't be helped.
Er(sad) - After seeing what was happening in the city I don't feel like we should've helped them even if we could.
