Later this evening Rose visited Annet's mansion on her own.

An - Hello, Rose. 
An - I'm glad that you've visited me.
An - I hope you don't think of me badly because of what I said.
An - In no way have I tried to degrade you.
Ro(talk) - N-no, I understand. 
Ro - I've come on my own here. Master, I mean, Arron would not let me go.
Ro(talk) - But I want to help Erika. 
An - I can assure you, Erika is in great condition.
Ro - I'll stay with you, if you let her go.
An - (Oh my, isn't this perfect)
An - Sure, this is very nice of you. 
An - If you become my subordinate, I'll let Erika leave.
Ro - Okay, I will. But... 
Ro(talk) - I want to see that she's fine. 
An - If you wish so.
An - Let's visit her right now.
An - Please, follow me.

Annet and Rose went to the prison cells where Erika was held captive.
An - You know, I quite adore reserved girls like you.
An - *You are really fun to play with.*
An - But what about Arron?
An - Isn't he going to return for you?
Ro(sarcastic) - H-He does not own me anymore. 
Ro(talk) - I'm free to decide what to do.
An - Ah, is that so. 
An - You do have some unusual features, must catch quite a bit of attention.
Ro(talk) - T-that's not true. 
Ro - But thank you for complementing it...
An - (Hah, she takes my attention as a benefit)
An - (Maybe I should take her right here)
An - (Maybe even next to Erika...)
An - We are here. As you can see, she's perfectly fine.
Behind the cell bars a girl's silhouette rests in the shadows.
Ro(talk) - Erika? Is that you?
Annet has put Erika's in shackles just in case she might attempt to escape.
Ro - C-can I see her closer?
An - Alright, I have a key with me.
An - Just let me unlock this...

Annet fell to the ground knocked out with Rose standing behind as she was unlocking the cell door. 
Rose held a small blackjack in her hand, which just got intimately acquainted with Annetâ€™s head
Ro(talk) - *Gasp*
Ro - Keys... Hold on, Erika.
Er(sad) - ...?
=SPRITE erika=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.3=
Ro - I'm getting you out.
Er(sad) - Rose... 
Er(sad) - How did you-
Ro(talk) - Not now, we have to escape.

Rose dragged Erika outside where Arron and others were waiting for her.
Ro - We did it.
Ar - Good job, Rose.
Er(sad) - Arron? Girls?
Em - We took care of the patrols.
Er(sad) - I'm... not... 
Ar(neutral) - We can talk later, you need some rest.

By the evening they safely returned home.
Ro(talk) - Thanks for the baton, Ember.
Ro - I managed to hide it so she had no idea.
Em - A-ha, it's nothing. 
Em - I'm glad I could be useful.
Er(sad) - I... was sure that I wouldn't see you again any time soon.
Ar - It was Rose's plan. 
Er(sad) - ...Rose? You risked yourself for me?
Ar - You must've fooled her well acting like prey.
Ro - It was rather scary.
Ro - I felt like she could easily push me around, if I were any younger.
Ro(sarcastic) - Or you haven't been pushing me around since childhood.
Ar - Filthy lies.
Er(sad) - I... I'm not sure I'll be able to ever repay you for this.
Er(sad) - But now you might get into trouble with city government.
Ar(neutral) - I don't think she's going to go that far.
Ar - Not until she's ready to proclaim what she was doing to you anyway.
Ar - And it's not like it's my first time getting into fights with local authorities.
Ro(sarcastic) - Please, don't make me remember.
Ar - We haven't even turned anything to cinders this time.
Er - Thank you, Rose. 
Er - I actually thought you would be happy with me gone too.
Ro(talk) - Stop it. I wouldn't feel right leaving you like that.
Ro(talk) - And I don't think bad of you, it's just... I'm...
Ro - Umh... 
Ri - She wants to say, she thinks of you as of a friend.
Ro(talk) - That's not...
Ro - Uh, well, maybe.
Er - I appreciate it.
