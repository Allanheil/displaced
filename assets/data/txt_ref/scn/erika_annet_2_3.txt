Ar - Hey Rose, what happened to Erika?
Ro(talk) - She said she was going to the city market yesterday
Ro - She hasn't returned since then.
Ar - Hmm... That seems a bit unlike her. 
Ro - Would you like to investigate?
Ar(neutral) - Yeah, I've been bored from sitting around here all day.
Ar - I hope she hasn't decided to live in a big city instead.

Str - The elven girl in skimpy clothes?
Str - Yeah, she was here yesterday. 
Str - Was causing some ruckus, then walked away with Annet.
Ro(talk) - Annet?
Str - Yeah, the city committee member, the one with horns.
Ar - Oh, right, that one.
Ar - What she's even about?
Str - Don't know much, really. 
Str - She was elected due to her business influence and money mostly.
Str - I think she's from an aristocratic family, or that's what she looks like anyway. 
Ar - Don't you find her weird though? 
Ar - Those horns and tail I mean.
Ar - She kinda looks like a succubus to me.
Str - Hey man, not cool. We arenâ€™t prejudiced.
Str - Anyone can be a good person.
Str - Especially when they have lots of money.
Ar - Uh huh, I guess we should check her estate then. 
Str - Yeah... Don't tell her I told you though.
Str - And don't comment on those things. 
Str - She does not seem to like it.
Ar - ...Thanks.

Ar - ...So we have been looking for her.
An - I see. Mr. Arron, right?
An - I do indeed know about Erika and where she is right now.
An - But there might be some difficulties.
Ar(neutral) - Such as?
An - You see, she's an old friend of mine and we have just reunited.
An - She wants to stay with me.
Ro - Does she really?
An - Of course she does, silly.
An - You don't believe me?
An - That's fine. Erika, please come in.

Ro - *Huh, she looks quite disturbed*
Ar - Hey, we were worried. How are you doing?
Er(sad) - I'm sorry for my disappearance, Arron, Rose.
Er(sad) - I will be staying with M-
Er(sad) - With Annet from now.
Er(sad) - You don't have to stay here.
Ro(shock) - Huh?
=SPRITE annet=
An - As you see, she's perfectly fine and stays here by her will.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, this does look a bit fishy.
Ro - ....
An - You are a clever man, Mr. Arron. 
An - You do look different from most people in this city. 
An - I can tell you aren't of lowly heritage.
Ar - Please, you are making me blush.
An - I'm not flattering you. 
An - I can see how others react to you, especially your companions. 
An - Rose, correct? 
Ro - ...
An - You see, to me there are two kinds of people in this world.
An - Those who rule and those who obey. 
An - Erika is obeying me, just as Rose obeys you.
An - That makes us alike, don't you think? 
Ro(sarcastic) - This is absurd.
Ar - Shush, don't make me bring your gag with us next time.
Ro(shock) - .....!
An - Ha, see! You get it.
An - You have come to me so you do hold interest in Erika. 
An - Since she has joined you before, you must be a responsible leader.
An - So I'm not wholly against letting her go.
An - But I do need someone around to help me with my... business.
An - Your girl, Rose, looks quite capable of that. 
An - What would you say if we switch for an uncertain period of time?
Ro(shock) - ..!
Rose noticed how Erika's eyes screamed "No", but did not say anything.
She was terrified by the idea of being left alone with Annet.
Ar(neutral) - This is a tempting offer...
Ar - But I'll have to consider it first.
Ar - If that's fine with you.
Ro - *C-consider?*
An - Of course not. 
An - Once you decide, I'll be waiting. 
An - I hope we can have a productive relationship in future.
Ar - Likewise.
