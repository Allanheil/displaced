Ro - Phew.. It's dead.
Em - There's an essence!
Em - Ew, it's all gross and sticky...
Er - Just image it's a semen.
Ro(sarcastic) - you are really not making this better.
Ar - It looks fancy. 
Ar - I wonder what it tastes like...
Ri - It doesn't really taste like anything. 
Ri - But you might grow a pair of horns if you digest it.
Em - Oh? But what if I already have one?
Ro(sarcastic) - Let's not try it.
Ro - Please let's return, I don't feel very good around here.
Ar - These are just walking corpses, I don't get why are you so scared of them.
Ro(sarcastic) - Don't make me recall how you reacted after going to family crypt for the first time.
Ar - Alright, alright. Let's go then.
As the whole team was leaving the room, Rilu slowed down behind.
Ar - Rilu? You found something over there?
Ri - ...
Ri - Nevermind, let's go.

At the other side of the hall two figures were watching from the shadows.
Z - Interesting... There's a familiar aura.
M - What's aura?
Z - Looks like these are the ones who Dimitrius told me about.
Z - Bastards destroyed about a week of my work.
M - oooh, that's bad.
Z - No shit, dumbass. 
Z - At least they've left.
Z - Alright, get back to preparations.
M - Preparations for dinner? I'm hungry...
Z - No, you imbecile. Now get to work.

Meanwhile Iola had finished her routine and was preparing to go to Arron again.
I - Phew, almost done here.
I - I should warn father, that I'm leaving.
She took a peek at her father's office before entering.
I - Huh, he seems to receive guests...

=SPRITE demitrius=
D - So you got rid of that dwarf king?
=SPRITE victor=
V - Sort of, wasn't me, but I finished the bastard.
D - Wasn't you?
V - Yeah, it seems like that guy got to him first.
D - I thought I ordered you to keep your eyes on him, idiot.
V - Whatever, from this world or not, he's no match for me.
V - I can kill him any time I want. 
D - That's not what I ordered.
D - Maybe we can use him to do our job.
V - Your job.
D - It will be your job if you fuck this up. 
V - *grunt*
D - Now get lost already, it's not good if we are seen here together here.
V - Oh is it? You probably should take care of peeping toms next time. 
D - Huh?
Before Iola realized it, the door in front of her was forced in and she was dragged inside.
I(shock) - What?! 
I(shock) - Let me go now! 
I(shock) - Father! What-
*Thud*
=SOUND punch=
V - Hell, I hate women.
V - Always so noisy.
D - Don't dare kill her. 
D - Shit, now I have to sort this out too...

A few days later.
=BG villageday=
=BLACKUNFADE 0.5=
Ar - This is weird. We got the essence, but Iola hasn't come back since that day.
Ro - Maybe they let her pass without it?
Ar(neutral) - That would suck.
Ar - How do we get rewarded like this then?
=SPRITE rilu=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
Ri - She's actually in trouble. 
Ro(talk) - Eh?
Ar(neutral) - What do you mean?
Ri - She was captured and kept imprisoned.
Ar - But how do you know that?
Ri - I've planted a small spirit on her.
Ro(sarcastic) - Why?
Ri - So I can know her condition and location.
Ar - That's something new.
Ar - Do you do this often?
Ri - Don't worry, you won't notice it.
Ro(sarcastic) - .....
Ar(neutral) - Anyway, where's Iola? 
Ri - I assume it's her cult grounds.
Ri(talk) - We should go there to save her.
Ar - Huh, you seem... Kinda worried? 
Ar - What happened to the deadpan girl I knew?
Ri(talk) - I'm not deadpan.
Ro(talk) - You think we should go there? 
Ro - This might be quite dangerous.
Ar - Well, someone has to pay for the mission we've completed. 
Ar - In the worst case we can loot something from there.
Ro(sarcastic) - I sincerely hope you are joking this time.
