Ro - Can I come in?
Ar - Sorry, I'm not quite in the condition for a liaison. Can you postpone it?
Ro - ...
Ro - Iola said that you were very lucky to survive that.
Ar - Yeah, felt like my organs became a paste. 
Ar - Hurt like hell too.
Ro(talk) - ...I did a terrible thing.
Ar - Huh, so it's about you now? Really supportive there.
Ro - Oh... Uh... Sorry...
Ar - I'm kidding, you twit. 
Ar(neutral) - Yeah, don't worry about it.
Ar - I knew you'd not in your mind since Dimitrius is a demon and all that shit.
Ro - ...That's not the entire truth. 
Ro - Those things I said about everyone... 
Ro(talk) - I really feel that way, at least sometimes.
Ar - ...So what? 
Ar - We all sometimes feel like we hate everything and everyone, especially about someone close.
Ar - You remember how you supported Ember when we met for the first time?
Ro - ...
Ar - And how you volunteered to save Erika, when she was captured, despite the danger?
Ro(sarcastic) - That was...
Ar - And how you yelled at me right before we ended up here. 
Ro(sad) - *sob* M-master...
Ro(sad) - I'm so sorry... Waaah...
Ar - Ouch, easy there...

Ar - Feeling better now?
Ro - *nod*
Ar - Jeez... I feel like I'm doing a therapistâ€™s job a lot lately.
Ro(talk) - I haven't thought about you being compassionate before.
Ar - Tell anyone and I'll kill you. 
Ro - I have to ask forgiveness from the others. 
Ar - Yeah, you can do that.
Ro - Thank you, Master. 
Ro - I'll be off now. Get well soon.

Ar - On a second thought... A liaison might not be a bad idea.
Ar(neutral) - Rose, wait, you hear me?
Ar - Darn it.
