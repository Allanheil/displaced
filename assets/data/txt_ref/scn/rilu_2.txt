Late at the evening Rilu was going to Arron's office. 
Ri - *Sigh*
Ri - *To think I'd be doing this...*
Ri - *Alright, Arron should be alone today.*
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=BG hall=
Arron sat at the table with a huge stack of paper he was going through.
Ar(neutral) - Complaint, complaint, complaint, credit application, complaint, credit...
Ar(neutral) - A request to invade a neighbor village...
Ar(neutral) - What the hell... It's like I'm still back at the kingdom, reading nobles' complaints. 
Ar - I should've made Rose take care of those. 
Ar - Who even taught goblins to write anyway?
Arron rose up and left the table. 
As he undressed preparing to sleep, an unexpected vision unveiled before him.
=MUSIC erotheme=
=ABG rilu_minet_1=
Ri - Hey, you don't mind some company at this time, do you?
Ar - Eh...? Rilu? 
Before him a half-naked Rilu stands at his? knees, lustly reaching for his manhood.
Ri - I'm in a bit of trouble here...
Ar - I don't remember you having animal ears.
Ri - Um, yes... 
Ri - Well, this is embarrassing...
Ar - More embarrassing than being naked? 
Ri - I've got possessed by a cat spirit.
Ri - And the poor thing was in heat.
Ri - It's hard to control myself...
Ar - Understood, you can rely on me.
=ABG rilu_minet_2=
Ri - Let me make you feel good.
Rilu stack out her tongue and slowly licked over Arron's cock like it's candy.
Ri - *slurp*
Ar - Ouch.
Ar - Slow down a bit, your tongue is rough.
Ri - Sorry *slurp* I'm not thinking very straight.
Ri - This smell... 
Ri - Drives me crazy.
=ABG rilu_minet_3 rilu_minet_4=
As Rilu feverishly worked over Arron's cock, her other hand was rubbing her pussy.
Ar - Mh.. It's unusual to see you being this proactive.
Ri - *slurp* You don't like it? 
Ar - Don't be silly. 
Ar - Variety like this is never bad.
Ri - I'm glad.
Ri - Let me try this...
=ABG rilu_minet_5 rilu_minet_6=
After saying that, Rilu took the whole thing into her mouth.
Ri - Mhm..
Her moans grew more exciting as she awkwardly coiled on Arron's penis.
Ar - Damn.
Ri - Mhmmmm... Thu likh ith? 
Ar - Oh... 
Ar - If you continue like this...
Ri - *slurp*
Not hearing, or probably even ignoring him, Rilu blissfully sucked his cock.
Ri - Come on.
Ri - *slurp* I want your milk...
Ar - Hah, won't make a girl wait.
Ar - Since you asked for it.
Ri - Mhmmm...
=ABG rilu_minet_7 rilu_minet_8=
=WHITE=
Ar - Aah!... 
Ri - Mh!...
Rilu's mouth filled with seed but she didn't break her hold.
Ri - *gulp* *gulp*
Ri - He-he, you came a lot.
Ar - That was mind blowing.
Ri - Thanks.
Ri - But I can't wait any longer.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=ABG rilu_doggy_1=
Rilu crawled on the floor before Arron, presenting her naked rear.
Ri - Please...
Ar - You don't have to ask me twice.
=ABG rilu_doggy_2 rilu_doggy_3=
Ar - Now it's a matter of honor to help you out.
Ri - Just hurry.
=ABG rilu_doggy_4 rilu_doggy_5=
Without dragging it any longer Arron penetrated Rilu's pussy much to her joy. 
Ri - Aaah!..
Ar - Are you alright? 
Ri - Y-yes, sorry...
Ri - I've been waiting for this for too long.
Ar - You never raised your voice like that.
Ar - And your pussy is incredibly wet.
Ri - Mmmhm...
Ar - Jee, you are so impatient now you are moving on your own.
Ri - ...Your thing inside...
Ri - It's so hard.
Ar - You turned into a really naughty kitten.
Ri - Meow...
Ri - Push it deeper...
Ri - Yes, scrap my insides...
Ar - Wow, your pussy is clamping quite hard on me.
Ri - Ah... Faster...
Ar - Ngh... Alright.
=ABG rilu_doggy_6=
Ri - Yes!
Ar - You've asked for it.
Ri - This feels amazing..
Ri - I'm... I'm coming!..
Ar - OOohhh!
=ABG rilu_doggy_7 rilu_doggy_8=
=WHITE=
With his last movements Arron pushed as deep as he possibly could, holding Rilu by the waist.
Ri - Nyahhh!
Ri - *Pant*
Ar - Hah..
Ri - It's filling my insides...
Ri - Your hot seed.
Ar - Did it help?
Ri - Absolutely.
Ri - Feels amazing to be alive.

Arron allowed Rilu to stay at his room for this night.
Ri - *I hope he didn't suspect anything?*

The girls and Arron are having dinner.
Em - Wow, this tastes great, Rose! 
Em(tired) - I wish I could cook like you.
Ro(talk) - It's nothing special.
Ro - I had to learn it as part of my training.
Er - The meat is quite unusual, never tried anything like this before.
Ro(talk) - Ah, it was Rilu's recipe. 
Ro - She helped me out today.
Ar - Ah, some ancient culinary? That's fancy.
=SPRITE rilu=
Ri - ...Yes, something like that.
Ri(talk) - Thanks for the meal, I should go now.
=SPRITE_FADE 0.5=
Ro(sarcastic) - Master, have you offended her recently? 
Ar - Can't imagine how.
Ro(talk) - She looked displeased after you spoke to her.
Ar(neutral) - Maybe it's my breath? 
Ar - It would be your fault then.
Em - Your breath smells fine.
Ro(sarcastic) - Wait, why would it be my fault?
Ar - It's your duty to make sure I don't embarrass myself.
Ro(sarcastic) - No, it's not.
Ar - Whatever. I'll go talk to her I guess.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=BG villagenight=
Arron went to Rilu's house.
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
Ar(neutral) - Hey. Is something wrong?
Ar(neutral) - I should probably apologize for the last time.
Ar(neutral) - You weren't yourself and I took advantage of it.
Ri - No, it wasn't really like that...
Ar - Oh, okay then.
Ar - So there's no tension between us?
Ri - That's...
Ri - Actually, I must confess.
Ar(shock) - You are pregnant!
Ri(talk) - Wha...? 
Ri - No, no, this isn't possible for me.
Ar - Phew...
Ar - What do you have on your mind then?
Ri - Before we met, I never cared much for sex.
Ri - Never was interested in it either.
Ar(neutral) - You did it though.
Ri - Not so much did it, as it was done to me.
Ar(neutral) - Eh?
Ri - Arron, not everyone out there was as nice to me as you.
Ri - Most people usually ostracized and feared me. 
Ri - Some because of my condition.
Ri - Some because of my practices.
Ri - And many did torture me, while some had experiments.
Ar(neutral) - This sounds awful.
Ar(neutral) - I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
Ri - Don't be, I've gotten used to it after all.
Ri - Probably because of it I never had much interest in intimacy.
Ri - Or so I thought.
Ri - Then there was that incident with the... Well...
Ar - Potency restoration.
Ri - i didn't expect it would be a very different experience to me. 
Ri - So much, that I started to think about it.
Ri - A... lot, actually. 
Ri - But even though I was interested in it now, I had no idea how to talk about it.
Ar - Hah, so you are kinda like Rose at that.
Ri - What do you mean?
Ar - Nevermind.
Ar - So I take it, you used a cat spirit as an excuse.
Ri - Yes. 
Ri - It was a bit unbearable at the time. 
Ri - I'm sorry about deceiving you.
Ar - Don't worry, that was a pleasure for me.
Ri - ... I'm glad you feel that way. 
Ar - You don't have to hold back if you need it at any time.
Ri - Can we do it today then?
Ar - You don't beat around the bush.
Ar - I think I have a fun idea.
Ar - Come to the townhall in one hour.
Ri - *Nod*

Some time later

Ar - Hop in.
Ar - Say, you aren't against some experiments?
Ri - .....
=MUSIC erotheme=
=ABG rilu_anal_1=
By Arron's instructions, Rilu laid on the side.
Ri - This is somewhat embarrassing.
Ar - Doesn't it make you excited? 
Ri - ...
Ar - Now let me show you...
=ABG rilu_anal_2 rilu_anal_3=
Arron pulled out a small wooden object.
Ri - That's...
Ar - A dildo.
Ri - Why...?
Ar - I want to play with you.
Ar - It's actually shaped like my dick. 
Ri - You really are a pervert.
Ar - Guilty. 
Ar - Now let's try to get it in...
=ABG rilu_anal_4 rilu_anal_5=
Arron slowly pushed a wooden dildo into Rilu's pussy.
Ri - Ngh...
Ar - Huh, you are quite wet already. 
Ar - It penetrated you easily.
Ri - It feels weird...
Ri - Ah!..
Ri - Why are you moving it...
Ar - You can't have sex without moving.
Ri - It feels good...
Ar - Of course, I'm a master at pleasing girls.
Ri - You can do it rougher.
Ar - Roger.
Ri - Ngh... Ah...
Ri - This is...
Ri - Feels similar to before...
Ri - A bit deeper.
Ar - You seem to really enjoy it.
Ri - I'm... I'm going to cum...
Ar - It's fine.
Ri - Aah, ahhh...
=WHITE=
Ri - AAAahhh!...
Ri - Hah... ah...
Ar - You look quite happy.
Ri - Stop teasing me.
Ar - Hmph, let's do something new now.
Ri - ...Huh?..
=ABG rilu_anal_6 rilu_anal_7=
Leaving dildo in Rilu's pussy, Arron pushed his cock into her butt.
Ri - Ah! 
Ri - Thats my ass!
Ar - Yep, how does it feel?
Ri - Aah... 
Ri - It feels weird...
Ri - Nh... Not entirely unpleasant.
Ar - Thought you might like it.
Ri - I can feel you throbbing.
Ar - Soon you'll feel much more than that.
Arron began moving inside of Rilu's butt.
Ri - Aaah... My ass...
Ar - Ngh...
Ar - How does it feel?
Ri - I... 
Ri - I-Ah... Think I'll start to like it...
Ar - Let's not forget about your pussy either.
While fucking Rilu's ass Arron also began to move the dildo he left in her pussy.
Ri - Ohhh-...
Ri - This...
Ri - This is too much...
Ri - You gonna make me..
Ri - Cum again..!
Ar - Gotcha.
Ar - Let's do it together.
=ABG rilu_anal_8 rilu_anal_9=

Ri - Aaah!!
Ar - Ngh... Hah...
Ar - Came inside your butt.
Ri - Ah...

Ar(neutral) - Hope you aren't having second thoughts.
Ri - .....
Ri(talk) - No. 
Ar - What's up with that pause?
Ri - I wonder if I always was this lewd.
Ar - Nothing wrong with having a bit of fun with someone you like.
Ri - You might be right.
Ri - ...Then I'll rely on you from now on. 
Ar - Alright, as long as you act normally. 
Ri - *Nod*
Ri - I can... Get used to it.

Arron followed Rilu until she entered Summerhill Keep as she carefully avoided any stray undead.
However, after a couple of rooms he lost a sight of her.
Ar(neutral) - Shit, where did she go.
Ar - Maybe coming like that into an undead ruin wasn't a good idea after all.
Arron's thoughts were stopped by a loud noise from one of the halls.
Ar(shock) - Damnit, what the...
A couple of undeads appeared rushing to the direction of noise, but spotting Arron.

In a large hall an unknown man laid defeated as Rilu was inspecting something in her hand.
Ar - Rilu? What's been going on here?
Ri - Arron.
Ri - You've been following me?
?(Z) - You should stop her... If you want to live.
Ar - Hmm? Who's this guy?
Ri - It's Zelroth. He used to be my student in the past.
Ar - I think I've heard this name in town. 
Ri - He used to be a gifted scientist and a doctor, but now he seems to prefer to raise the dead instead.
Ar - ...And that thing in your hand?
Ri - ........
Rilu demonstrates a small black ring. 
Ri - It's an ancient artifact - The Circle.
=SPRITE zelroth=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.1=
Z - She plans to destroy the world with it.
Ar - What?
Ri(spell) - Stay down.
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Invisible force has pushed Zelroth back onto the floor.
Z - Gh!..
Despite that he continued to talk.
Z - Long time ago an ancient race had this ring.
Z - It's the ultimate doomsday device.
Z - And it's capable of destroying our whole reality.
Ar(neutral) - That's a bit hard to imagine.
Z - Why don't you ask your "friend" then.
=SPRITE rilu=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
Ar(neutral) - ...Rilu?
Ri(talk) - I believe it to be true.
Ri - The world is in perpetual motion. 
Ri - People are born, live and die, their children are born to repeat the cycle. 
Ri - The sun rises only to set and then repeats this cycle indefinitely
Ri(talk) - That's the nature of existence, the one we are in, at least.
Ri(talk) - The Circle supposedly can stop it once and for all.
Ar(neutral) - You came here for this?
Ri - Yes. This was my goal all along. 
Ri - I was planning for it long before we met.
Ri - I have deceived you so I could find the ring.
Ar(neutral) - But why?
Ri - I can explain, but I don't expect you to understand it.
Ar(neutral) - No hurt in trying.
Ri - ...
Ri - I hate this world. 
Ri - And I hate this life.  
Ri(talk) - I have been evil all along.
Ri(talk) - And I want it to be destroyed. 
Ar(neutral) - But why would you kill yourself? 
Ri(talk) - *Sigh*
Ri - Because life to me is endless suffering.
Ri - I've told you before, my existence is nothing but agony.
Ri(talk) - I'm dead tired of being injured, tortured, left at the mercy of a mob or a toy for some maniac.
Ar(neutral) - I don't get it. Aren't you fine now? Don't you have fri-
Ri - I said, you won't understand it.
Ri - This is only a glimpse of peace in my eternity.
Ri - These never last long for me.
Ri(talk) - You can live and die, but I'll keep existing.
Ri - I'll be feared and hunted again in no time.
Ri - This is the cycle of my life, and I hate it. 
Ri - I hate people and nothing is better than ending it once for all.
Ar(neutral) - ...Is that really so? 
Ri(talk) - You won't stop me. 
Ar(neutral) - I don't believe you. 
Ri(talk) - Stop being stup-
Ar(neutral) - You are right. I can't understand how terrible your suffering was. 
Ar(neutral) - But I do understand that it's bad enough to make you wish to end the world.
Ar(neutral) - It must be why you show so few emotions too.
Ar(neutral) - Must really put off the bastards who tortured you for fun.
Ri - .......
Ar(neutral) - But you are also lying through your teeth.
Ar(neutral) - You aren't evil, and you absolutely don't hate people. You hardly used us either.
Ri - You are not making any sense.
Ar(neutral) - Despite all hardships you don't blame others.
Ar(neutral) - And you don't show any real grudge towards them.
Ar(neutral) - You care for me and you cared enough to save Iola, even though you hardly knew her.
Ar(neutral) - You pretend to be evil, because this way you hope to make me reject you.
Ar(neutral) - So you would have an easier time doing what you've planned
Ar - But I won't hate you. 
Ar - And I'm sure the other villagers and girls like you as well.
Ri(talk) - ...Shut up.
Ar(neutral) - What happened to you is unfortunate... No, terrible. 
Ar - But I can swear to you that nobody will abuse you as long as I live.
Ar - This might be not much for you, but this much I can guarantee. 
Ar - Don't you think that killing us all can wait for some time? 
Ar - I can't stop you after I'm dead anyway.
Ri - ...Y-You won't fool me.	
Ar(neutral) - You know I'm being serious. 
Ri - (What's this... Why am I trembling?)
Ar(neutral) - So, what do you say? 
Ar - The others might get worried if they find out we are missing. 
Ar - And it looks like something got in your eyes.
Ri - ......
Rilu wiped her face with a sleeve.

Ri - I dropped it when you pushed me.
Ar(neutral) - Oh... Sorry.
