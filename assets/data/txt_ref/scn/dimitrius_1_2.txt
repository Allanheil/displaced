As Dimitrus goes slightly behind the group, Rose talks to the Arron.
Ro - We are in a tight spot here. 
Ro - If our origin goes public, they will certainly proclaim us to be demons.
Ar - Relax, he does not seem to suspect anything.
Ar - Once we are done with his task, he's going to leave and it will be all good.
Ro - I suppose...
Ro - The villagers do seem to pay him great respect though.
Ro - Thankfully, it does not seem like they actually believe in this whole demon idea.
Er - Of course it's all nonsense.
Ro(shock) - EH? You were listening all this time?
Er(happy) - Don't worry, my lips are shut.
Er - Unless you are interested in my oral skills.
Ro - *Sigh* Let's just get this over with.
