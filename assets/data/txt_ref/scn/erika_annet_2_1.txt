Taking a day off Erika walks through Aeros' market.
M - Hey, elf girl. 
M - Looking for something specific?
Er - Nah, Just checking around.
M - Oh right, you are from that desert village. 
M - You don't have to dress that skimpy around here though. 
Er - Don't worry, it's one of my favorite outfits.
M - A-ha, alright then.
EC - No, please let us go!
Erika turned to the noise from the other side of the market.
=MUSIC STOP=
A pair of captured children, no older than twelve, were sold to an obese rich man.
RN - Shut it, you cur.
RN - I've paid a good sum for you.
EC - *sob* Please, I want to see my mom.
RN - They are pretty unruly.
RN - Don't worry, you'll work off your price in bed and become real ta-

Before the man could notice it, Erika punched him into the face, quickly freeing the children after that.
Er - Run kids.
Without a second thought they disappeared into the crowds.
RN - You... Bitch! What do you think you are doing?!
Er(anger) - The right thing.
RN - You don't know who I am? I'm Hector Blackthrorn.
Hearing that name made people around pay more attention as it was one of the city's strongest families.
RN - Those slaves cost me 12 thousand gold.
RN - You better pay up now.
RN - Or should we turn you into the city guard.
Er(anger) - ...
Erika noticed how people were gathering around her, attracted by the ruckus.
RN - Hah, there's no way you can carry this much money in your garment though.

An - What's going on here, Hector?
Er - ...?
RN - Ms. Annet? It's nothing requiring your attention. 
RN - This elf just made me lose a pair of freshly bought slaves.
An(anger) - Trying to get your filthy hands on the poor kids again, are you?
An(anger) - That's disgusting, and it's only natural someone would want to save them.
RN - This is not against the law, and I paid fair and square. 
RN - I demand my money back!
An(anger) - Hmph, fine. You'll have your gold, make sure it will serve something better than your perverted hobbies.
Hearing this, the previously distant crowd began cheering Annet.
Str - Wow, Ms. Annet really is a respectable committee member.
Str2 - This is what all rich and nobles should be like.
RN - Hmph, fine.
RN - Have it your way, this time. 
After receiving the confirmation letter, Hector walked away.
An - Now, that is taken care of...
An - I would like to have a word with you...
An - Your name is Erika, right?
Erika went numb from hearing her name. 
Her previous readiness to fight drains from her.
