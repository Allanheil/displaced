Ro - Master, I've found an old stone coffin in the other room. But it was too heavy to open for me.
Ar - An old coffin? Alright, in the worst case we can settle down here as well. Let's see it.

Ar - Looks pretty ancient. What are these letters?
Ro - I can't tell, does not look like anything I've seen back in our world or here.
Er - It says... 'Beware... the absolute evil... within... should not be released'
Er - And something about radish?
Ro - Radish? What does that have to do with radish?
Er - I dunno. The letters are hard to make out.
Ar - You know this language?
Er - Nah, not really. It just looks familiar. 
Ar - What? How do you read it then?
Er - I might have accidentally learned it sometime in the past. Who really cares?
Ar - Right. Let's open it.
Ro(shock) - Master! You've heard what it says, we can't just randomly open it. 
Ar - Whatever, it also says some nonsense we can't reliably decipher. 
Ar - Plus there's nothing else to do. Don't be a scaredy-cat.
Er(happy) - I agree. This is like a lottery. Who knows what might be inside?
Ro - ... I can't believe we actually made it this far.
Ar - Alright, Ember help me out.
Em - Alright!
As the heavy lid is removed it reveals a young girl lying inside.
=BG scenes/rilu_1=
Ro - Eh?
Er - ...
Ar - ...
The party held a briefing, unsure what to do with their discovery.
Em - Oh... Emergency ration? 
Ro - Ember, you eat humans!?
Em - Ah-hah... No, I just wanted to break the silence. 
Ar - Hmm she's kinda cute. 
Ro(sarcastic) - ...Really?
Arron extended his arm and poked the lying girl's face. 
Ro(shock) - Master!
Ar - Oh, she's actually warm.
Ro(shock) - Remember what the letters said!
Ar - That was obviously nonsense. You know, cute makes right.
Ar - She's cute so she can't be evil.
Ro - No, no, that's certainly a possibility here.
Ar - Rose, don't be so prejudiced. We might end up in a similar coffin one day.
Ar - It would be pretty sad if you were treated evil just because of that, wouldn't it?
Ar - Also, isn't it like a Snow White story?
Ar - I admit, the dwarves are not quite what I imagined, but I'll take it as an unusual twist.

Ri - Muh...
Unexpectedly, the girl in the coffin woke up, opened her eyes and exhaled a sleepy mumble.

Ar - Hello there. 
Ri - Who are th...
The girl's face shows a sign of pain and irritation.
Ri - Darn...
Er - She bit her tongue...
Ro - She seems pretty clumsy. Is it because of sleep?
Ar - Anyway, we were passing by and found this place by chance. I'm Arron, this is Rose, Erika, and Ember. 
Ar - What about you? 
Ri - Me?
Ar - Yeah, your name.
Ri - ...
Ri - Riluth'sierhn.
Em - Rilusiah?
Ro - Rilutseyn?
Er - Rilyseya?
Ar - Not even gonna try. How about just Rilu?
Rilu showed no objection, and everyone settled with calling her so. 
Ar - So we seem to be a bit stuck here. Do you wanna join us?
Ri - ...
Ri - Were you the one calling me cute?
Ar - Guilty. 
Ri - Nonsense. Are you fooling me?
Ar - Why would I be?
Arron said it sincerely, but after taking a glance at his friends, he spotted their uneasiness.
Ri - Huh... a weird man.
Ri - Fine. I'll accompany you.
Ro - But before that, Rilu, could you tell us what were you doing in that coffin? 
Ri - ...
Ri - I fell in there a long time ago. I think it was cursed and the lid closed on its own.
Ro - Really? This is... something I can probably imagine.
Ar - That makes sense. Alright, let's move to the exit.

Ri(spell) - Step back.

A sphere of spirit energy has shot from Rilu and dispelled the wall revealing the ambush behind it. 
Ri - ...
S - SHOOT!
A loud explosion shook the whole cave as a steel ball flew from the cannon at great speed.
With no time to react, Arron and the rest could only shout as it struck Rilu creating a blood-filled smoke.

Em(tired) - I'm sorry, they are numerous and really tough.
Ar - Shit, the king is coming at us now!
KD - You have fought well kid, but you've messed with the wrong warriors.
KD - My ax demands its nourishment!
Ar - You crazy midget fucker...
Ar - (This is not good, maybe we should try to escape at this point...)
Er - Arron, look!
Arron turned to the side Erika pointed at, broadening his eyes in disbelief.
Rilu slowly stood up on her knees. 
Ro(shock) - Rilu! How are you...
Ri - Ugh... I really hate when this happens.
The dwarven king shows no sign of hesitation being completely overwhelmed by combat haze. 
KD - What an interesting girl! Look like an ideal practice target, Hahaha.
Previously expressionless Rilu's face now lit with magic glow displayed an angry look mixed with determination.
Ri(spell) - Arron, allow me to give you a hand in this matter.
Ar - Sure, we could use more than just a hand right now.

Having his forces defeated, the mortally wounded dwarven king fell to the floor. 
Ar - Phew... finally. 
Ar - Thanks Rilu, you were a great help. 
Ro - Indeed, we wouldn't make it without you. 
Ro - But how did you... Well...
Ri - It's okay. I can't die. 
Em - You do bleed a lot though. 
Er - Ember, that was a bit too rude.
Em(tired) - Oh... Sorry...
Ri - Don't worry about it. I have a habit of such.
Ar - But what was that magic you used? I don't think I've seen it before.
Ri - I'm a necromancer. It's a power of both the dead and spirits. 
Ro - (S-spirits? I knew it must be something creepy, but this is even worse...) 
Ar - Awesome! You can do something like that? 
Ar - I swear, the dead are so useless on their own. Can you also make skeletons and zombies?
Ri - W-well...
Er(happy) - Sir Arron is really into weird things.
Ar - Hey Rose, why are you so pale all of a sudden? 
Ar - Wait, you are still afraid of ghosts and stuff? Come on, you are an adult now.
Ro - I-I'm not, I'm just tired from the fight. Anyway, let's leave this place already.

Ro - So there's no place or friends you can return to? How sad. 
Ri - Don't worry about it.
Ri - I've gotten used to it.
Ar - Make yourself at home, we still have some unoccupied rooms.
Ro - Your help was immeasurable, but I'm actually curious.
Ro - How come someone like you became a necromancer? 
Ri - .....
Ro - I mean in the tales necromancers are usually creepy evil old folk.
Ri - I've been studying my condition. 
Ar - Your immortality? 
Ri - Yes. 
Ri - Unfortunately I've only managed to kill myself another couple dozens of times.
Ar - But your skills are rather useful. 
Ar - And more importantly, awesome.
Ro - Rilu... How old are you?
Ri - Hmm... I'm not sure. What year is it? 
Er - 3485.
Ri - ...
Ri - 600-ish something. 
Ri - I think I've had at least a few hundred combined in isolation though. 
Everyone in the room aside from Rilu went into a silent state.
Ar - I bet you all wish you’d stay this young for so long.
Ro(sarcastic) - I dunno about that.
Er - Nah, I'm good.
Ri - I heavily advise against it.
Ri - So, I can really stay with you?
Ar - No, you must stay with us. 
Ar - I'm not going to let a live friendly necromancer not join us.
Ro - If Master has set his mind on something, he'll always stick to it.
Er(happy) - This harem seems to get weirder and weirder. 
Ar - Plus, there's a thing you might be able to help us out with.
Ri - Ah?

As they finished explaining their problem, Rilu has harshly broken their hope.
Ri - I've never heard about such means of transportation.
Ri - However, there might be one person I know who might know something.
Ar - Huh? Wouldn't all people you know be feeding the worms?
Ri - Normally. That isn't as big of a deal as I could summon their spirits, but I'm not actually sure if he's dead. 
Ri - A few centuries ago there was a small religious group worshipping the deity. 
Ri - According to them, he was the creator of this world, which was born from his dandruff.
Ro - Ew.
Ri - Yes. They did seem like just a bunch of lunatics, but I've actually met them before I met the group.
Ar - Did you get any of his dandruff by chance? 
Ar - I mean you could sell it to those guys...
Ri(blush) - No, but I've realized he's been living for much longer than me.
Ri - So I began to pursue him, to see if he knows something about my problem.
Ri - But he wasn't weak like me. And he knew nothing about it either. He didn't reveal his secrets either. 
Ri - I've seen him teleport like you are speaking about as if it were as simple as walking.
Ri - He also insisted that he wouldn't interfere with this world's business.
Ar - So you think he's not of this world as well?
Ri - Back then I thought it was the case. 
Ar - That's actually something. Let's try to see what we can find then. And thanks, Rilu.
Ri - ...Don't mention it.

Ri - Now for this thing...
Ar - Hey there. Whatcha doing?
Ar - What's with this weird statue.
Ri - It's a request from one of the villagers. Seems like this thing is cursed.
Ar - A request? Do you take things like that?
Ri - Yes. This is crucial for sustaining this miserable existence.
Ar - Don't be like that, I'm sure this must be better than being buried alive. 
Ri - Yeah. I was talking about everyone else though. 
Ar - ...
Ar - Can I see it?
Ri - Do as you wish. 
Ri - ...
Ri - There really is a malicious spirit in it. 
Ar - Woah, can you deal with it?
Ri - Hmph, who do you think I am?
Ri - Let's see...
Rilu chanted a spell and a small puff of smoke erupted from the statue in her hands.
To her surprise though, it swiftly dashed towards Arron quickly diving into him.
Ri - Oh...
Ar(shock) - What the hell? What just happened?
Ri - I think it invaded you.
Ri - It must be stronger than I anticipated.
Ar(shock) - Can't you do something?
Ri - I... can take a look, but let's go someplace else so it won't go after other people.

Ri - It seems the spirit has brought disease upon you.

Ri - Erectile dysfunction.
Ar(shock) - No no no no no no no no no no no.......
Ar(neutral) - Can you help with this? You surely can, right?
Ar(shock) - It's your fault I was cursed in the first place!
Ri - I can, but it would be better if you also ask Rose or someone else for assistance.
Ar(neutral) - No way. I can't let anyone else know about it.
Ri - ... 
Ri - I see. I'll do it then. 
Ri - Excuse my inexperience.
Freeing Arron from his pants, Rilu began to clumsy feel up his penis with her hands.
Ri - ...
Ri - It seems to twitch a bit.
Ar - This is a good sign, right?
Ri - Perhaps.
After another half minute, Rilu backed off dropping her cloak on the floor.
Ri - Lay down.
With a feeling of uneasiness, Arron landed on the bed.

Rilu awkwardly positioned herself on top of him facing away. 
Letting out a small gasp she pressed her naked rear against his flaccid cock.
Ar - What are you doing...?
Ri - Quiet. You should concentrate now.
Ri - It blocks out your sexual energy, so to dampen it you need to have someone else's energy until it breaks.
Ri - This is why I said you should ask someone else.
Ri - This is the first time I've done something like this...
Rilu began to grind her bare crotch against Arron.
Ar - ...
Ar - (Maybe I should have. She's pretty clumsy.)
Ar - (Although, she doesn't seem to mind too much.)
Ri - Mh... Like this?
Ar - (Oh, I can feel her getting wetter.)
Ar - (This actually isn't too bad.)
Ri - Nhhh… this feels weird...
Even without seeing Rilu's face Arron still could tell her voice was showing more feeling.
His cock gets warmer with every brush of her pussy over it.
Rilu’s breath grew more ragged as her juices covered Arron's penis.
Ar - Oooh!
=ABG rilu_cowgirl_2 rilu_cowgirl_3=
With a flash through his mind, he felt the evil energy leave his body instantly making his cock rock hard and suddenly enter Rilu.
Ri - Ahhh!
Ar - Woah, You did it Rilu! I feel like its gone.
Ri - Nhhh... It went inside...
Being full of Arron's cock Rilu weakly twitched, unsure what to do.
Arron spotted her confusion and decided to take initiative.
Ar - But we better make sure it's fully functional, right?
Ri - What are you...
Arron helped Rilu by supporting her body from the back and slowly moving in turn.
Ar - It won't feel right leaving you excited like this.
Ri - Nnh? Ah...
Ar - I should also make you feel good as thanks for your work.
Ri - Arron... 
Ri - Ahh!
Arron slowly pushed himself in and out of Rilu.
Ar - No surprise, you are pretty tight.
Ri - You’re stirring up my insides... Nhhh...
Ri - I feel so weird...
Ar - You really don't have any experience do you? Well then I’ll have to make this a night you’ll always remember.
Ar - Yet, you have such a sexy moan.
Ri - You dare to.. Ah... Ridicule me?
Ar - Of course not. I like you this way.

Ri - You are a weird man, Arron. I'm not used to being taken care of.
