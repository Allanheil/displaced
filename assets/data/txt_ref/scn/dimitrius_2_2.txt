The team barges into the main room with Dimitrius in it.
=SOUND doorsmash=
De - Ah, I almost forgot about you, fools.
Er(anger) - Stop screwing around. Give our friends back!
De - How about "No"?
Ar(neutral) - Figured asking nicely wouldn't work with you. 
Ar - So how about a trade then?
De - Hah, what can you possibly offer to me? Your lives?
Ar - How about this? 
Arron presents the previously acquired black ring.
De - An interesting thing, but what good does it do to you? 
De - You would never dare to use it anyway. 
Ri - You are right. He wouldn't. 
Ri - But I will.
D(anger) - Hmph, is that so?
Ar(neutral) - You know she would, if you don't want your existence completely erased, give us back Rose and Iola.
De - Hahahah, Fine.
De - You can take Iola, I'm already bored with her.
De - Rose, on the other hand, has something to say about it first.
=SPRITE rose=
Ar(shock) - Rose!
Ro - Thanks for coming, but you can go now.
Em - Eh? 
Ro - I'm not going back with you.
Ro(talk) - I'm joining Dimitrius.
Er(anger) - What? Why?
Ro - This is for the best.
Ro - I'm tired of all this.
Ro(talk) - Deep inside, I hated every single one of you.
Ro(talk) - Ember is stupid and gullible.
Em(sad) - Eeeh?
Ro(talk) - Erika is a shallow harlot.
Ro(talk) - Rilu, you just creep me out. 
Ri - You wouldn't be the first.
Ro(talk) - And Master... You are the worst irresponsible womanizer I've ever met.
Ro - It was me, who told your brother about your affair with his wife.
Ro(talk) - You told me to choose what I wanna do with my life.
Ro(talk) - I don't want to see any of you anymore from now on.
Er(anger) - ...
Em(sad) - ...
Ar - Yeah, nice work Dimitrius, now let's return to the deal.
Ro(shock) - Eh? You didn't hear what I said!?
Ar - I don't care.
Ro - ...
De - Aahahah, really nice one Arron. I'm very impressed.
De - Fine, you can have your girls. 
Ro - N-no way! What was that?
De - Sorry sweetie, Arron wins this round.
De - I can't allow them to destroy my reign.
De - They are yours.
Iola and Rose mechanically are relocated to the Arron's side.
De - *snap* 
I - Uh... Oh... Where am I?
Ro - ...
De - Here, they aren't under my influence anymore. 
De - Now give that to me.
Rilu silently threw the ring in Dimitrius' direction. It vanished in a thin air.
De - Good, you made me worry for a moment there. 
De - That's quite an achievement for you pests.. 
Er - You act all high and mighty, but we got our friends back from you. 
Er - Your plan failed.
De - What? 
De - Aahahah, holy crap, you thought my plan was to steal your friends?
De - You actually are an idiot.
De - You only interested me because of your connection to the other dimension, and now I've achieved it anyway.
Ro - N-no way!?
De - Yeah, I never really cared if you join me or not, Rose, but it's always fun to make mortals hate each other.
De - This was fun while it lasted, but it's time to finish with this world already.
De - And once we are done here, it's your home's turn.

=SOUND sound_crack=
Ar(shock) - Eh? What's going on?
Ri(talk) - This is bad, we should stop him.
Ar(anger) - Shit, no other choice!..
De - Don't make me laugh you wimp.
Unexpectedly to everyone, Dimitrius pulled an unknown metal object from his back.

With loud explosive noises it spewed a rain of pellets in the direction of Arron.
=SOUND sound_splatter=
Ar - Agh!.. Guh...
Ro - Master! 
De - Ahahaha, humans can make some really fun toys.
Ar - Damn bastard...
I - Stay still, you are bleeding!

De - But enough of that. 
De - Be grateful, you get to see the birth of a new world.
Ri - !?
Ar(neutral) - What's... happening?
De - Just making a few changes around here.
Er(anger) - This place is going down.
Ri(talk) - We must retreat.
Ar - ...
De - Run, weaklings, run.
De - Use what little time you've left for your own good, hahaha.
