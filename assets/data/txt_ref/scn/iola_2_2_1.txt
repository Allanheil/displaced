Em - Oh? But what if I already have one?

Ro - Please let's return, I don't feel very good around here.
Ar - These are just walking corpses, I don't get why are you so scared of them.
Ro(sarcastic) - Don't make me recall how you reacted after going to family crypt for the first time.

M - What's aura?
Z - Looks like these are the ones who Dimitrius told me about.
Z - Bastards destroyed about a week of my work.
M - oooh, that's bad.
Z - No shit, dumbass. 
Z - At least they've left.
Z - Alright, get back to preparations.
M - Preparations for dinner? I'm hungry...
Z - No, you imbecile. Now get to work.
