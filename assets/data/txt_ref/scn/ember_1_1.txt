Ro - There's a new visitor who wants to meet you. Her name is Ember.
Ar - Oho, a new lady? Finally, this position begins to pay off. Come on in!

Em - Hey!
Em - You are the mayor, right?!
Em - My name is Ember.
Ar - Shit, Rose, there's a dragon on the loose!
Ro(sarcastic) - Uhm... this is the visitor. 
Ar - Huh... well, at least youâ€™re not a goblin.
Ar - (She's certainly the hottest dragon I've ever seen. Although, for others, it was generally their biology. )
Ember seemingly pays no attention to the commentary.
Em - I'm sorry, am I being too blunt again? Ah-ha, Sorry...
Em - Wow, this place is really great! And you look very representative as well!
Ar - It is, indeed. My skills were recognized by the folk so I was found to be the most suitable ruler.
Ro(sarcastic) - Indeed, given you were the only candidate.
Ar - I'll have to penalize you for spilling my trade secrets.
Ar - Anyway, what brought you here? 
Em - Ah, You see, I'm a blacksmith's...
Em - ...apprentice.
Em - It might not sound great, but I was one for a really long time!
Em - Since this town has a ruler now, you do need a blacksmith, right?
Em - Someone to take care of tools, weapons and armor. Please, let me start a forge here!
Em - I'm a bit short on money as of now, but...
Em - If you allow me to open my personal shop, I will craft whatever you need as a payment. That's a great deal, right? 
Ro(sarcastic) - Does anyone even need a smith shop around here..?
Ar - A valid point, why here of all places?
Em - I'll tell you, but it's a secret, so don't tell anyone, alright? 
Ar - Sure, I'll just force Rose to wear a gag whenever she goes out, to make sure she stays quiet. So?
Ro(sarcastic) - *Frown*
Em - Have you seen the competition?
Em - Do you realize how much profit I'll be making with no other blacksmiths around? This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop!
Em - I might not look like it, but I have studied my craft.
Em - This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop!
Ro - ...

Ar(neutral) - This is an impossible request.
Em(sad) - What? But I went such a long way...

Ember's eyes began filling with tears.
Ar - No, we can't allow a half-dragon into our town, this would go against safety reg...
Em(sad) - *Sob*

Ro(sarcastic) - What? I can't believe you are so cruel to her. Look, she's crying.
Ar - We can't be driven by woman's emotions in hefty decisions.
Ro - Hmph, I'm leaving then.
Ar - You can't leave. You were mine to start with!
Ro - That was in Avior, here I'm free to do what I want. 
Ro - Now, let's go Ember, I'm sure we will find a more friendly place than this.
Ar - Is that so? You'll regret this!

Being left alone, Arron failed as Mayor and has been exiled by the goblins.

Ar - Fine, I'll allow it. You will have to sign a number of contracts first, though.

Ember's face quickly changes into an image of pure relief.

Ro - You might be wro...
Ar - That's a great idea! Just sign a couple of contracts and you can start right away.
Embers eyes shine with happiness
=POSITION 4=
Em(happy) - Wow, thank you, Arron! I'm so indebted to you for this.
Ro(sarcastic) - (What a coincidental use of words.)
Em - You won't regret it!
Ar - So, you gonna need a house for a forge? We might be able to assemble something...
Em - Oh, there's no need. I brought my house with me! It's on the hill right outside of town.
Ro(talk) - Huh, really. Did you carry it all by yourself? Half-dragons can do stuff like that? 
Em - Ha-ha, I've always been carrying stuff around the forge, so I wouldn't get in the way of Master's work. 
Ar - Well, that's all the better for us, but I'll have to tax you for taking town's space. 
Em - Okay!
Ember has joined the settlement. Forge is available now.
