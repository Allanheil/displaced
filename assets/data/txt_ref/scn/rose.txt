Ro - (Sigh... After ending up here, I thought at least I could be alone with Master, but now there's Erika and Ember...)
Ro - (Even though I feel lonely, he ignores, and even mocks me like that.)
Ro - (Of course he's from a royal family and is used to having many women.)
Ro - (But I can't lose to them after all we went through.)

Rose enters Arron's room, who seems to be already asleep.
Ro - Master...
In a few moments she disappears under the blanket.

Ro - Mm... *lick*
Ro - (Master's scent... being so close drives me crazy.)
With only a couple of licks Rose manages to bring Arron to full erection.
Ro - (Already so hard... Seems like he had no other affairs today.)
Ro - (Alright, then it's a perfect chance  for me to take care of his needs.)
Ro - *Slurp*
Ro - Mmh... 
Ar - *yawn* Hmmm... who might be here?
Ar - Oh... This masterful technique can be none other than my cute pet's.
Ro - Hmp.. *slurp*
Ar - Giving a blowjob in the middle of the night like this. 
Ar - What a naughty girl.
Ar - But it makes me rather happy. 
Ar - You learned all the right spots.
=ABG rose_minet_2 rose_minet_3=
Arron affectionately rubbed Rose's head and ears in response to her effort.
Ro - (What am I even thinking, starting it this way...)
Rose's left hand unconsciously moved to her drenched pussy.
=ABG rose_minet_4=
Ro - Mm... Master, pet me more...
Ar - You are such a spoiled girl, aren't you.
Ar - Just a little bit more...
...
Ar - Here it comes...

Ro - ...!
At the last second Rose released Master's penis from her mouth, making it shoot all over her face.
Ro - Ah... Jeez.
Ar - Oh-ho... Still not comfortable with swallowing?
Ro - Sorry, Master...
Ar - It's okay. Are you ready to continue?

Arron's penis still stood at attention despite just cuming, much to Rose's relief.

Rose swiftly mounted him.
Ar - Just look how wet you are from merely sucking my dick. 
Ro - I-It's your fault, making me like this...
Ar - Aha, talking back to your Master? And putting it in without permission as well?
Ignoring her Master's mocking, Rose longingly impaled herself on his cock.
=ABG rose_sex_2 rose_sex_3=
Ro - Master... 
Ar - Mhmm, you seem really desperate. Fine, I will excuse it this time.
Ro - This is... because you didn't approach me for so long... Ah!
Ar - He-he... So my plan has worked.
Ro - Ah... Stupid...
Rose was losing herself to pleasure with every move.
=ABG rose_sex_4=
It always surprised her, how different she was acting compared to her everyday uptight personality.
Ro - I feel so full...
With each movement Rose's gasps grow deeper and deeper.
Ar - Oh, I love your passion...
Ro - I'm almost there...
Ro - Ah... Master, please, hug me!
Not waiting for a reply, Rose embraced and kissed her Master, as his seed filled her womb.

Umh... 
Ro - Ah... I did it again...
Ar - Good girl. Alight, you can sleep together with me.

Rose weakly nodded and buried her face into Arron's chest.

Ro - Can I come in?
Ar - Sorry, I'm not quite in the condition for a liaison. Can you postpone it?
Ro - ...
Ro - Iola said that you were very lucky to survive that.
Ar - Yeah, felt like my organs became a paste. 
Ar - Hurt like hell too.
Ro(talk) - ...I did a terrible thing.
Ar - Huh, so it's about you now? Really supportive there.
Ro - Oh... Uh... Sorry...
Ar - I'm kidding, you twit. 
Ar(neutral) - Yeah, don't worry about it.
Ar - I knew you'd not in your mind since Dimitrius is a demon and all that shit.
Ro - ...That's not the entire truth. 
Ro - Those things I said about everyone... 
Ro(talk) - I really feel that way, at least sometimes.
Ar - ...So what? 
Ar - We all sometimes feel like we hate everything and everyone, especially about someone close.
Ar - You remember how you supported Ember when we met for the first time?
Ro - ...
Ar - And how you volunteered to save Erika, when she was captured, despite the danger?
Ro(sarcastic) - That was...
Ar - And how you yelled at me right before we ended up here. 
Ro(sad) - *sob* M-master...
Ro(sad) - I'm so sorry... Waaah...
Ar - Ouch, easy there...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
...
Ar - Feeling better now?
Ro - *nod*
Ar - Jeez... I feel like I'm doing a therapistâ€™s job a lot lately.
Ro(talk) - I haven't thought about you being compassionate before.
Ar - Tell anyone and I'll kill you. 
Ro - I have to ask forgiveness from the others. 
Ar - Yeah, you can do that.
Ro - Thank you, Master. 
Ro - I'll be off now. Get well soon.
=SPRITE_HIDE=
=SOUND slam=
Ar - On a second thought... A liaison might not be a bad idea.
Ar(neutral) - Rose, wait, you hear me?
Ar - Darn it.
