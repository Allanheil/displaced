Ar - Oh, an unexpected visitor.
I - Good day Sir Arron! 
I - Are you doing well?
Ar - Better than ever.
Ro - What brings your here?
I - I'm on the pilgrimage.
I - Actually, I was supposed to do it at a different time, but the Cult ruled for me to do it now.
I - I feel like it was father's initiative though. 
I(sad) - He acts differently since the time he returned.
Ar - What sort of pilgrimage?
I - I was requested to get Spirit Essence for the cult. 
I - So I thought maybe I could ask you to get it?
Ar - But isn't that supposed to be a task you have to complete personally? 
I - No, not really. Cult just uses initiates to gather it for future sellings.
I - Many do just buy it or hire someone to get it.
Ar - That's creative.
Ar - But what do you even need that for?
I - We make aphrodisiac out of it.
Ar - Hooh. An important industry for sure.
Ar(neutral) - It's fine if you are paying, but we might need some tips where to find it.
I(sad) - I'm sorry, I don't really know about that.
Ar - I guess we better ask our pocket sage then.

Ri - Pleased to meet you.
I - Likewise. I'm Iola. 
I - How come you have a lone little girl here?
Ro(talk) - She's actually quite old.
I - Oh, really?
I - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Ri - Don't worry, I'm used to it.
Em - Yeah, she's really old, like granny.
Ro(sarcastic) - Ember, please. 
Ar - Rilu, Iola is looking for something called Spirit Essence.
...
=BLACKFADE 0.25=
Ri - I see.
Ri(talk) - Yes, I know where we can get it. 
Ri - There's an abandoned castle nearby.
Ri - It goes by the name Summerhill Keep.
Ro - Oh, that's a nice name.
Ri - According to the rumors it is brimming with stray undead.
Ro(sarcastic) -  Of course.
Ri - We are likely to find it there.
Ar - A full house of zombies. Should be fun.
Ro - Ugh...
I - Thank you.
I(sad) - I wish I could go with you, but I have to continue the sister training.
I - Please be careful out there.

Ro(sarcastic) - you are really not making this better.
Ar - It looks fancy. 
Ar - I wonder what it tastes like...
Ri - It doesn't really taste like anything. 
Ri - But you might grow a pair of horns if you digest it.
Em - Oh? But what if I already have one?
Ro(sarcastic) - Let's not try it.
Ro - Please let's return, I don't feel very good around here.
Ar - These are just walking corpses, I don't get why are you so scared of them.
Ro(sarcastic) - Don't make me recall how you reacted after going to family crypt for the first time.
Ar - Alright, alright. Let's go then.

D - That's not what I ordered.
D - Maybe we can use him to do our job.
V - Your job.
D - It will be your job if you fuck this up. 
V - *grunt*
D - Now get lost already, it's not good if we are seen here together here.
V - Oh is it? You probably should take care of peeping toms next time. 
D - Huh?
Before Iola realized it, the door in front of her was forced in and she was dragged inside.

Ri - She was captured and kept imprisoned.

Ri - I've planted a small spirit on her.
Ro(sarcastic) - Why?
Ri - So I can know her condition and location.
Ar - That's something new.
Ar - Do you do this often?
Ri - Don't worry, you won't notice it.
Ro(sarcastic) - .....
Ar(neutral) - Anyway, where's Iola? 
Ri - I assume it's her cult grounds.
Ri(talk) - We should go there to save her.
Ar - Huh, you seem... Kinda worried? 
Ar - What happened to the deadpan girl I knew?
Ri(talk) - I'm not deadpan.
Ro(talk) - You think we should go there? 
Ro - This might be quite dangerous.
Ar - Well, someone has to pay for the mission we've completed.

I(sad) - He's been acting weird and I eavesdropped on his guest.
Ar - Curious, but I think it would be better if we leave first.
Ar - Your colleagues don't seem very friendly either.
I(sad) - No, I can't.
I - It's father's order so there should be some reason.
Ar(neutral) - Look, your father locked you in a jail like this.
Ar(neutral) - Even if he's not psycho, you won't make things better by staying here.
Ro - Plus he ordered the guards to attack us. 
Ro - It's not sane to stay here.
I(sad) - No, this must be some mistake.

I - You've mentioned you are looking for some person? 
Ar - Yeah, according to Rilu there's someone who has been living for a really long time and probably came from another world as well.
Ar - And we also got this Saint Pearl from Faery Queen, which seems to be related to him.
I - This reminded me of Sergius. 
I - He's one of the Ancestors' saints. 
I - I've been studying it during my initiation. 
I - And you are planning to find him?
Ar(neutral) - Don't see any better options.
I(sad) - It's hard to believe he'd still be alive. 
I - He was one of the former a long time ago, but it never said what happened to him.
I - Please, let me help you. If he's actually the Sergius, he would know what's going on. 
I(sad) - Although I don't know why he would just avoid us if he's still alive.
Ro - Maybe he has lost his memory or something. 
Ar - Or just got bored of the religious stuff.
I(shock) - No way!
Ar - What? Don't you ever feel bored by the repetitive rituals?

Ar - ...It might be a bit late, but how exactly is this your training?
I - As a cult's Vestal I'm obliged to spread love and provide pleasure to those in need.
Ar - That's the most convenient religion agitation I've ever heard.
I - So to become a proper Vestal I need to train at it.
I - So.. Um, we can start if you don't mind.
Ioal casually freed Arron's penis from his pants.
