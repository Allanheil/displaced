Ro - We made it...
Er - Yes, come in, it's after this door.
Ro(talk) - Great.
Rose and Erika entered the room filled with glowing glass screens.
Er - Alright, it's your turn.
Ro - Uh... This might take some time.
Er - You sure you can manage it?
Ro(sarcastic) - No, it would help if you could help me out too.
Er - You know I'm too stupid for this stuff.
Ro - ...Just let Rilu know we got there.

Meanwhile Arron kept escaping from Dimitrius.
After making through another room he ended up in a small room connected to a giant curved structure.
Without taking a pause he opened a small hatch and jumped inside, sealing it shut behind him.

Right as he finished, Dimitrius predictably appeared next to him. 
=SOUND slash=
Arron attempted to land a surprise attack, but Dimitrius blocked it.
Ar(anger) - Damn you.
D - It seems your brilliance is finally overshadowed by your human nature.
D - What a stupid thing to trap yourself in this place even though I can easily  teleport.

=SPRITE rilu=
Meanwhile Ember, Rilu and Iola ran from the other side of the tunnel. 
Ri - Ember, give it to me.
Em - Sure.
Ember passed Rilu a small piece of red cloth that she managed to rip off Dimitrius' outfit during the fight.
Ri - Erika said they got to the control room as well.
Ri - Iola, you can start making your preparations.
I - Got it!
=SPRITE demon=
Demon - Arghh!
Em - Oh no, they found us!
Ri - We have no time for this.
