Today Arron and Ember have gone to Aeros to get new supplies for the forge.
Em - This is so cool, so many people and nobody threw anything at me yet!
Ar - People around here seem really uncaring for anything.
Ar - Including your attire.
Em - Look, this coal looks really great! Can we buy it?
Ar - If you think so, I'd rather leave it to you.

In a few minutes Ember brought lots of large, fullcrates and loaded them onto the cart.
Em - Phew, this should be enough.
Ar - Fine, let's return before I lose my mind in this crowd.

Ar - I'm still amazed how you can carry so much, including your cart, just by yourself.
Ar - Must be nice to be so strong.
Em - A-ha, it's nothing big, I'm not that strong.
Ar(neutral) - Really?
Em - Back in my old village some people were stronger than me, like my master, who used to beat me often to improve my discipline.
Ar - You were probably just a child, though.
Em - I always win in endurance contests though!
Ar - No way.
Em - I'm serious.
Ar - ...
Ar - I bet I could beat you.
Em(happy) - Really? You’re gonna compete with me? Let’s race home and see who gets there first!
Ar - No, I wouldn't wanna break anything from the goods. I have a better idea.
Em - Ah?
Ar - Come here.

Em - Sir Arron, I don't understand. Didn't you want to challenge me?
Ar - Yep, this is the contest. 
Em - Eeeh? I've never heard about a contest like this.
Ar - It's better than running and we can find out who lasts longer.
Em - Oooh, I'm not going to lose then!
Ar - Let's start then.
Em - Ah! Don't put it in so suddenly!
Ar - Sorry.
Em - Nh-ah...
Em - We are doing it again, he-he.
Ar - Hey, stay focused, this is a contest after all.
Em - Ah!..
Ar - And you might be losing it soon.
Em - Eeeh!? Why?
Ar - Who comes first loses. 
Ar - And you are already so wet.
Em - Ha-ah, that's not fair!
Ar - That's loser talk.
Em - Nhaah, I'm not going to lose so easily!
Ar - Hmh, we'll see about that. Now take this!

Em - Aah, this is nothing!...
Em - But it feels so good...
Em - Aaah...
Ar - Haah, perhaps you are a worthy opponent after all.
Em - This is... ah... really different from running...
Em - Aah...
Em - More, faster...
Ar - Jeez, you are a real fiend.
Ar - Are you ready to lose to me?
Em - No way... Ah...
Ar - You might be tough, but you are no match for my stamina.
Em - No, no... Aaah, I'm cumming!
*white flash*

Ar - Hah, with this..
Ar - Here's my reward!
*white flash*
Em - AAah... I'm feeling so full...
Ar - Haaah... You fought well, Ember.
Em - I lost... But, it felt so good...

Em(sad) - Aww, can't believe I lost.
Em - You really are strong, Sir Arron. 
Ar - Certainly, but that might've been more skill than pure strength.
Em(shock) - Ooh? What do you mean?
Ar - I'm sure you can do better if we practice more often.
Em(happy) - We'll train more in future then?
Ar - You can bet on it.

Ro - Oh, Master, you are back. Everything went well?
Ar - Of course it did. Did I ever fail you?
Ro(sarcastic) - ...
Em - Ah. Hi Rose. Sir Arron is really strong. 
Em - You know, he could even beat me!
Ro - Uh huh.
Em - But I think it's because he trains with you every so often.
