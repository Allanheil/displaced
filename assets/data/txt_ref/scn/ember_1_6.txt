Arron and Ember have gone to Aeros to get new supplies for the forge.
Em - This is so cool, there are so many people here and nobody threw anything at me yet!
Ar - People around here seem not to care about much at all.
Ar - Including your attire.
Em - Look, this coal looks really great! Can we buy it?
Ar - If you think so, I'd rather leave the coal to you.

After a few minutes Ember brings lots of large, full crates and loads them onto the cart.
Em - Phew, hopefully this should be enough.
Ar - Fine, let's return before I lose my mind in this crowd.

Ar - I'm still amazed how you can carry so much, including the cart, all by yourself.
Ar - Must be nice to be so strong.
Em - A-ha, it's nothing really, I'm not that strong.
Ar(neutral) - Really?
Em - Back in my old village some people were stronger than me, like my master, who beat me often to improve my discipline.
Ar - You could only have been a child.
Em - I guess so. I always win in endurance contests though!
Ar - No way.
Em - I'm serious.
Ar - ...
Ar - I bet I could beat you.
Em(happy) - Really? You’re gonna compete with me? Let’s race home and see who gets there first!
Ar - No, I wouldn't wanna break any of the goods. I have a better idea.
Em - Ah?
Ar - Come here.

Em - Sir Arron, I don't understand. Didn't you want to challenge me?
Ar - Yep, this is the contest. Now bend over. Put your hands on that tree
Em - Eeeh? I've never heard about a contest like this.
Ar - It's more fun than running and we can find out who lasts longer. 
Em - Oooh, I'm not going to lose then!
Ar - . We’ll see. And so we begin.

Arron unceremoniously enters Ember, shoving his cock into her up to the hilt.
Em - Aaah! Don't put it all the way in so suddenly!
Ar - Sorry.
Em - Nh-aah… It’s’ so big...
Em - We are doing it again, he-he.
Ar - Hey, stay focused, don’t forget this is a contest.
Em - Aaah!..
Ar - And you might be losing it soon.
Em - Eeeh!? Why?
Ar - Whoever cums first loses. 
Ar - And you are already so wet.
Em - Ha-ah, that's not fair!
Ar - Sounds like loser talk.
Em - Nhaah, I'm not going to lose so easily!
Ar - Hmh, we'll see about that. Now take this!
Arron increases his speed, pounding Ember’s tight pussy as she braces against the tree.
Em - Aah, this is nothing!...
Em - But it feels so good...
Em - Aaah...
Ar - Haah, perhaps you are a worthy opponent after all.
Em - This is... aah... really different from running...
Em - Aaah!
Em - More, faster, oh yesss...
Ar - Jeez, you are a real fiend.
Ar - Are you ready to lose to me?
Em - No way... Aaah!
Ar - You might be tough, but you are no match for my stamina.
Em - I can- Oh! Oooh!
Em - No, nooo... Aaah, I'm cumming!

Em - Aaaaaahhhh! You win, you win!
Ar - Hah, and with that…
Arron grips her hips and thrusts his cock deep inside Ember’s pulsing pussy.
Ar - I take my reward!

Em - AAah... I'm so full of your seed… I think I’m leaking…
Em - I can feel it trickling down my thighs.
Ar - Haaah... You fought well, Ember.
Em - I lost... But, it felt so good…
Ar - You’re still inexperienced, but you have a lot of natural talent
Em - For all the good it did me...

Em(sad) - Aww, I can't believe that I lost.
Em - You really are strong, Sir Arron. 
Ar - Certainly, but that might've been more skill than pure strength on my part.
Em(shock) - Ooh? What do you mean?
Ar - I'm sure you can learn to last longer. 
Ar = We just need to practice more often.
Em(happy) - We'll train more in future then?
Ar - More and harder. You can bet on it.

Ro - Oh, Master, you are back. Did everything go well?
Ar - Of course it did. Have I ever failed you?
Ro(sarcastic) - ...
Em - Ah. Hi Rose. Sir Arron is really strong. 
Em - You know, he could even beat me!
Ro - Uh huh.
Em - But I think it's because he trains with you every so often.
Ro - …
Em - But he says we’re going to train more…
Em - So I can last longer.
Ro(sarcastic) - Trains? With me?
