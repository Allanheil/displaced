The team has barged into the main city hall as Annet meets them there.
An - Look what we have here.
An - Can't say I expected to see you still alive.
Ar(neutral) - I knew you were a one kind of a bitch after learning your history with Erika.
Ar(neutral) - But must say, this is a whole different level. 
An - I'm glad you appreciate my work.
Ro(shock) - Your work? 
Ro(shock) - You are slaughtering innocent people!
An - People, cattle, who cares.
An - I'm glad we are finally past the acting stage and I don't have to deal with their stupidity.
An - Won't deny it, I did have my fun a couple of times though.
An - But it was taking too much time.
Ar(neutral) - Whatever, let's just beat the shit out of her.
An - Tsk, you are throwing away the few minutes of life I am gifting you.
An - And with such bad manners too.
An - I'll take care of your friends, once you die, Arron.

An - Gh, you degenerates...
An - Demons, crush them!
A horde of large demons swarmed the hall from all directions.
Ar(shock) - Oh shit!
Ar(shock) - Stay together.
Ro - There's too many
Em - Ngh...
An - How does it feel to be outnumbered now?
An - Ha-h, lets see how long you'll hold up.
An - But while we are at it...
I(sad) - This looks really bad, there's no end to them.
An - *Chanting*
An - Erika, return to my side!
Er(sad) - .....
Ro(talk) - Eh... Erika?
Ar(shock) - Where are you going?
Er(sad) - I'm... sorry.
Ignoring the battle and enemies, Erika left the team and slowly walked into Annet's direction.
Ro(shock) - No way...
An - Hahah, you imbeciles!
An - Did you seriously think I'd leave my toy with no security measures?
Ro - You are the lowest.
Ro(talk) - Stop, Erika!
An - Don't waste your breath.
An - She was hypnotized long time ago to obey my will on command. 
Ri - We won't hold without her...
An - You know how to secure victory?
An - Never leave things to chance, a backup plan is mandatory.
An - Isn't that nice, Eri...?
=BG scenes/annet_erika_1=
Whole room froze in awe as Erika stabbed Annet's neck.
An - Wha...t...
An - Why...
Er - You are right.
Er - Never leave things to chance.
Er - You really thought I would never learn about your hypnosis and find out how to resist it? 
An - You... biiitch!.. 
Er - I've learned from the best.
An - Ghhh!..
*Slash*
=BG scenes/annet_erika_2=
An - Nnooo!..
A red splash erupted from Annet's neck as the dagger sliced it through.
Er - Go to hell, Mistress.

With Annet's defeat all demons in the hall quickly retreated from sight.
Er - Phew... 
Er - I'm shaking now.
Er - But somehow feel great.
Ar - Yeah, you've saved us.
Er - Turns out, I'm a pretty good actress, huh?
Ro - You really made us worried. 
Er - I've realized she'd always treat me as her victim.
Er - So I thought this would be a safer approach.
Ar - Well, looks like we saved a city at least.

D - Nice work, insects. 
Ar(anger) - Dimitrius!
D - Now, don't look so mad.
D - You've done me a great service today and I'll spare your lives for some time.
Ar(neutral) - You talk highly for someone who'll be gutted by the end of this.
D - Ahahah, nice one, Arron. 
D - You actually have no idea how troublesome it is to kill another demon lord with a big reputation in this world. 
D - But you actually did it.
Ro - You wanted her dead? That's why you didn't help her?
D - That's what I said. 
D - I actually thought about giving you a hand on one occasion, but you managed anyway.
Ri - You've left your kin here to die like that.
Ro - They don't think of their own any higher than of normal people.
Em - You really aren't afraid to lose?
D - What, do you really  think I should be worried about you?
D - You just don't understand, do you?
D - You are not a threat. You killed Annet, but she was weak and stupid. 
D - I can squash you all like bugs, but you never know when you might need a couple of resourceful mortals.
I - We'll stop you and end this madness.
D - Yeah, sure, struggle some more if you wish.
D - Have your little celebration, for today.
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Ar(neutral) - ....He's gone.
Ri - There seems to be a crowd outside.
Ro - Those are probably the survivors. 
=BG hall=
Surv - It was you? You defeated the demons?
Ar - No, we just were really persuasive.
Surv - Eh? 
Ar - Let's return to the village. 
Ro - Agreed, this was a tough day.
Surv - But what should we do? What if demons return?
Ar - I'm afraid my charisma is too low to take you all.
Ar - You will have to figure out how to defend yourself eventually.
The team left puzzled civilians.
I(sad) - I wonder if we should've left them like this.
Ar(neutral) - It can't be helped.
Er - After seeing what was happening in the city I don't feel like we should've helped them even if we could.
