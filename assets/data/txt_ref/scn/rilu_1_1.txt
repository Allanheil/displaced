After meticulously inspecting the caves, the party concluded there are no visible exits with the only one being blocked by an energy wall.

Ro - Master, I've found an old stone coffin in the other room. But it was too heavy to open for me.
Ar - An old coffin? Alright, in the worst case we can settle down here as well. Let's see it.

Ar - Looks pretty ancient. What are these letters?
Ro - I can't tell, does not look like anything I've seen back in our world or here.
Er - It says... 'Beware... the absolute evil... within... should not be released'
Er - And something about radish?
Ro - Radish? What does that have to do with radish?
Er - I dunno. The letters are hard to make out.
Ar - You know this language?
Er - Nah, not really. It just looks familiar. 
Ar - What? How do you read it then?
Er - I might have accidentally learned it sometime in the past. Who really cares?
Ar - Right. Let's open it.
Ro(shock) - Master! You've heard what it says, we can't just randomly open it. 
Ar - Whatever, it also says some nonsense we can't reliably decipher. 
Ar - Plus there's nothing else to do. Don't be a scaredy-cat.
Er(happy) - I agree. This is like a lottery. Who knows what might be inside?
Ro - ... I can't believe we actually made it this far.
Ar - Alright, Ember help me out.
Em - Alright!

As the heavy lid is removed it reveals a young girl lying inside.

Ro - Eh?
Er - ...
Ar - ...
The party held a briefing, unsure what to do with their discovery.
Em - Oh... Emergency ration? 
Ro - Ember, you eat humans!?
Em - Ah-hah... No, I just wanted to break the silence. 
Ar - Hmm she's kinda cute. 
Ro(sarcastic) - ...Really?
Arron extended his arm and poked the lying girl's face. 
Ro(shock) - Master!
Ar - Oh, she's actually warm.
Ro(shock) - Remember what the letters said!
Ar - That was obviously nonsense. You know, cute makes right.
Ar - She's cute so she can't be evil.
Ro - No, no, that's certainly a possibility here.
Ar - Rose, don't be so prejudiced. We might end up in a similar coffin one day.
Ar - It would be pretty sad if you were treated evil just because of that, wouldn't it?
Ar - Also, isn't it like a Snow White story?
Ar - I admit, the dwarves are not quite what I imagined, but I'll take it as an unusual twist.

Ri - Muh...
Unexpectedly, the girl in the coffin woke up, opened her eyes and exhaled a sleepy mumble.

Ar - Hello there. 
Ri - Who are th...
The girl's face shows a sign of pain and irritation.
=MUSIC eventgeneric=
Ri - Darn...
Er - She bit her tongue...
Ro - She seems pretty clumsy. Is it because of sleep?
Ar - Anyway, we were passing by and found this place by chance. I'm Arron, this is Rose, Erika, and Ember. 
Ar - What about you? 
Ri - Me?
Ar - Yeah, your name.
Ri - ...
Ri - Riluth'sierhn.
Em - Rilusiah?
Ro - Rilutseyn?
Er - Rilyseya?
Ar - Not even gonna try. How about just Rilu?
Rilu showed no objection, and everyone settled with calling her so. 
Ar - So we seem to be a bit stuck here. Do you wanna join us?
Ri - ...
Ri - Were you the one calling me cute?
Ar - Guilty. 
Ri - Nonsense. Are you fooling me?
Ar - Why would I be?
Arron said it sincerely, but after taking a glance at his friends, he spotted their uneasiness.
Ri - Huh... a weird man.
Ri - Fine. I'll accompany you.
Ro - But before that, Rilu, could you tell us what were you doing in that coffin? 
Ri - ...
Ri - I fell in there a long time ago. 
Ri - I think it was cursed and the lid closed on its own.
Ro - Really? This is... something I can probably imagine.
Ar - That makes sense. Alright, let's move to the exit.
