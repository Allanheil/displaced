KD - Haha, these surfacers are quite feisty. 
Ro(shock) - Master, we can't fight them for much longer. 
Em(sad) - Sorry, they are numerous and really tough.
Ar - Shit, the king is coming at us now!
KD - You have fought well kid, but you've messed with the wrong dwarves.
KD - My ax demands its nourishment!
Ar(anger) - You crazy midget fucker...
Ar(anger) - (This is not good, maybe we should try to escape at this point...)
Er - Arron, look!
Arron turned to the side Erika pointed at, broadening his eyes in disbelief.
Blood covered Rilu slowly stood up on her knees.

Ro(shock) - She's alive!
Ri - Ugh... Not this again.
The dwarven king shows no sign of hesitation being completely overwhelmed by combat haze. 
KD - What an interesting girl! Look like an ideal practice target, Hahaha.
Previously expressionless Rilu's face now lit with magic glow displayed an angry look mixed with determination.
Ri(spell) - Arron, I'll join if you don't mind.
Ar - Not gonna stop you.
