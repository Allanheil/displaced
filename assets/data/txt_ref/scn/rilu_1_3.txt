KD - Haha, these surfacers are quite feisty. 
Ro - Master, we can't fight them for much longer. 
Em(tired) - I'm sorry, they are numerous and really tough.
Ar - Shit, the king is coming at us now!
KD - You have fought well kid, but you've messed with the wrong warriors.
KD - My ax demands its nourishment!
Ar - You crazy midget fucker...
Ar - (This is not good, maybe we should try to escape at this point...)
Er - Arron, look!
Arron turned to the side Erika pointed at, broadening his eyes in disbelief.
Rilu slowly stood up on her knees. 
Ro(shock) - Rilu! How are you...
Ri - Ugh... I really hate when this happens.
The dwarven king shows no sign of hesitation being completely overwhelmed by combat haze. 
KD - What an interesting girl! Look like an ideal practice target, Hahaha.
Previously expressionless Rilu's face now lit with magic glow displayed an angry look mixed with determination.
Ri(spell) - Arron, allow me to give you a hand in this matter.
Ar - Sure, we could use more than just a hand right now.
