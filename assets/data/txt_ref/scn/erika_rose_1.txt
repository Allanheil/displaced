Er - Arron.
Ar - Erika. What's up?
Ar - Another irresistible itch demanding a good scratching? 
Er - No. I mean, yes, but not exactly what you think.
Er - Remember how you gave me your approval on Rose?
Ar - Uh-huh.
Er - She's a tough nut to crack, so I could use your help. 
Ar - I don't think ordering her around will work. 
Er(anger) - I beg you, I'm never going to force anyone like that.
Er - What I need is a rare herb we elves often use for relaxation. 
Er - So can you help me get some of that? 
Ar - I suppose. But is it safe for non-elves? 
Er(happy) - Of course it is. It's just rather hard to come by since elves cultivate it secretly.
Ar - Fine, you got my interest. So where are we going?
Er - Oh, it's not far in the woods. I'll lead the way.
