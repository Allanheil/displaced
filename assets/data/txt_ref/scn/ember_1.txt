Ro - There's a new visitor who wants to meet you. Her name is Ember.
Ar - Oho, a new lady? Finally, this position begins to pay off. Come on in!

Em - Hey!
Em - You are the mayor, right?!
Em - My name is Ember.
Ar - Shit, Rose, there's a dragon on the loose!
Ro(sarcastic) - Uhm... this is the visitor. 
Ar - Huh... well, at least you’re not a goblin.
Ar - (She's certainly the hottest dragon I've ever seen. Although, for others, it was generally their biology. )
Ember seemingly pays no attention to the commentary.
Em - I'm sorry, am I being too blunt again? Ah-ha, Sorry...
Em - Wow, this place is really great! And you look very representative as well!
Ar - It is, indeed. My skills were recognized by the folk so I was found to be the most suitable ruler.
Ro(sarcastic) - Indeed, given you were the only candidate.
Ar - I'll have to penalize you for spilling my trade secrets.
Ar - Anyway, what brought you here? 
Em - Ah, You see, I'm a blacksmith's...
Em - ...apprentice.
Em - It might not sound great, but I was one for a really long time!
Em - Since this town has a ruler now, you do need a blacksmith, right?
Em - Someone to take care of tools, weapons and armor. Please, let me start a forge here!
Em - I'm a bit short on money as of now, but...
Em - If you allow me to open my personal shop, I will craft whatever you need as a payment. That's a great deal, right? 
Ro(sarcastic) - Does anyone even need a smith shop around here..?
Ar - A valid point, why here of all places?
Em - I'll tell you, but it's a secret, so don't tell anyone, alright? 
Ar - Sure, I'll just force Rose to wear a gag whenever she goes out, to make sure she stays quiet. So?
Ro(sarcastic) - *Frown*
Em - Have you seen the competition?
Em - Do you realize how much profit I'll be making with no other blacksmiths around? This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop!
Em - I might not look like it, but I have studied my craft.
Em - This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop!

Ember's eyes began filling with tears.

Ar - We can't be driven by woman's emotions in hefty decisions.
Ro - Hmph, I'm leaving then.
Ar - You can't leave. You were mine to start with!
Ro - That was in Avior, here I'm free to do what I want. 
Ro - Now, let's go Ember, I'm sure we will find a more friendly place than this.
Ar - Is that so? You'll regret this!

Ro - You might be wro...
Ar - That's a great idea! Just sign a couple of contracts and you can start right away.
Embers eyes shine with happiness
Em(happy) - Wow, thank you, Arron! I'm so indebted to you for this.
Ro(sarcastic) - (What a coincidental use of words.)
Em - You won't regret it!
Ar - So, you gonna need a house for a forge? We might be able to assemble something...
Em - Oh, there's no need. I brought my house with me! It's on the hill right outside of town.
Ro(talk) - Huh, really. Did you carry it all by yourself? Half-dragons can do stuff like that? 
Em - Ha-ha, I've always been carrying stuff around the forge, so I wouldn't get in the way of Master's work. 
Ar - Well, that's all the better for us, but I'll have to tax you for taking town's space. 
Em - Okay!
Ember has joined the settlement. Forge is available now.

Em - I see you found some unusual wood up there. Please, let me have it!
Ar - Hmh... sure. What's so unusual about it?
Em - Oh, I can use it to make items with special properties. 
Ar - You can do that? You are pretty useful after all.
Em - Ha-ha, You are so kind, Sir Arron! I can also cook scrambled eggs! 
Ar - That's amazing. What are those properties anyway?
Em - Depends on the material used, it can make you stronger, faster... stuff like that.
Ar - Ho-oh. Can it make my wood stronger? 
Em - Huh? Your wood? You are not a human?
Ar - Nah, I'm actually a half-ent. 
Em(happy) - REALLY?!
Ro(sarcastic) - Please, don't trust everything people say.
Ar - But I do have wood, occasionally, maybe you could help with it.
Em - I don't quite understand, but sure!
Ro(sarcastic) - He lies to you, he has no lumber. 
Ar(neutral) - Tsk... I've trusted you, Rose. Such a brutish move from you. 
Em(tired) - Uh... I still don't understand, but in either case, if you find any more rare materials, make sure to bring them to me!
Ar - Aren't I'm one of a kind?

Em - Sir Arron, great to see you! What can I help you with?
Ar - I'm good. Just curious how you are doing.
Em - Oh, it's great here! And you visit me regularly too. 
Em - In the past people didn't seem to like having me around the village, but you seem so relaxed about it.
Ar - I'm a dragon's descendant just like you.
Em(happy) - What?! REALLY?
Ar - Maybe. 
Em - Oh... that might be true because you are not afraid of me.
Em - My appearance must be what repulses other people... Do you think I'll be able to find some place where I would be accepted?
Ar - Hmmm. True, people want to see something similar to them, rather than different. 
Em(tired) - Oh... this makes me sad. 
Ar - But you know what? You might still eventually pass for a human. 
Em - Oooh? I can? 
Ar - Naturally, you have some human characteristics, after all, I'm just not entirely sure how authentic they are.
Em(tired) - Uh... Sorry, I don't understand.
Ar - I'm saying that I'll need to investigate your body to see if you can pass for a human.
Em - OOOOH, Sir Arron, you can do this for me!? 
Ar - Well if you request it, it's my job to make sure everyone here is happy. 
Em - Okay, please! Let me just untie my apron.
Ar - (Darn.. this was way too easy, maybe later I should give her a couple of lessons about dignity)

Em - So, how is it?
Ar - Hmmm... Let's see.
Arron slowly circles around Ember.
Ar - You look rather healthy to me.
Em - I do? Master always said I heal very fast. 
Em - He did hit me a lot too, but I didn't feel much. It was kinda funny, ha-ha.
Ar - Is that so...
Arron grabbed one of Ember's tits and forcefully rubbed it.
=ABG ember_boobs_2 ember_boobs_3=
Em - Ah!
Ar - Did it hurt?
Em - N-no, it was just so sudden...
Ar - I see, softness seems to be rather good. 
*Pinch*
Em - A-ah!...
Ar - Hmm sensitivity seems to be good as well...
Ar - (Darn... I might be enjoying it too much)
Em - ...Sir Arron? 
Ar - Oh by the way, You don't really need to add 'Sir' for me.
Em - I don't?.. Ah!
Ar - Sorry, was it too rough? 
Em - No, it just... feels weird.
Ar - Mh-hm, this is a good sign. Very nice...

Ro - Master, what are you doing?!
Ar - What's up? Ember just asked me for help.
Ro - (Ember made a move on the Master!? I never expected that...)
Em - Oh Hey Rose. If you are in no hurry, give us a moment.
Ro - Ah... I'm just... Sorry...
Rose quickly shuts the door.
=BG forge=
Ro - (No way... She never looked mature like that)
Ar - Hmm, this is enough I believe. 
Em - So how is it?
Ar - This seems passable to me. With some time and work you will surely be able to live with humans nicely.
Em - Really!? This makes me so happy. Please, help me in the future too, Sir Arron!
Ar - Gladly.

(Townhall, Ember in the center)
Em - Sir Arron!
Ar - What’s up, Ember? You look excited. 
Em - Can we have sex?
Ar - ...Sure, but why? 
Em - It feels really good and it's about time for me.
Em - And you already said I'm pretty.
Ar - This doesn't sound like you came up with this yourself.
Ar - Who told you that?
Em - My dragon instincts.
Ar - ...
Ar - (Is this a trap?)
Ar - (Nah, It's definitely a trap.)
Ar - Sure, the bedroom is over there.
Em - Ahaha... Okay, sorry that I’m not really sure what to do.
Ar - Uh... before that, are you sure that you want to do it with me for your first time? 
Em - Yep. Why?
Ar - Well, people usually do it with someone they really like. 
Em - I really like Sir Arron!
Ar - Welp, my conscience is satisfied.
Arron pushed Ember down while removing her apron.

Em - Ah... What are we gonna do on the bed?
Em - Ah!... Sir, Arron?
Without replying Arron starts massaging Ember's virgin mound.
Em - This is how we have sex? I feel a bit weird.
Ar - This is just the start. Looks like it really is your first time.
Em - Is that bad?
Ar - Nah, I actually feel a bit honored.
Saying that Arron pushed his lips into Ember's while massaging her chest and pussy.
Em - Mmmhmmn... You kissed me...
Ar - You didn't like that?
Em - I did! Sex feels really good.
Ar - This isn't sex yet, though.
Em - Eh? It's not? 
Ar - Yep, this is just a foreplay. 
Arron quickly freed himself from clothes, revealing his manhood to the curious dragon girl.
Em - Woah, it's so big... That's called a penis, right?
Ar - Hmh um, it is great, indeed.
Ar - Now relax, this might be painful for your first time.
=ABG ember_miss_2 ember_miss_3=
Arron forcefully entered Ember's pussy.
Em - Oh... Ah!
Em - It's in!
Ar - Huh... It didn't hurt?
Em - No, it only stung a bit, but it feels really good.
Ar - Darn, it must be good to be a dragon's descendant. Oh well.
Em - What are you...
Meeting no resistance from Ember, Arron begins to slowly grind her wet pussy.
Em - Mmh... I feel... Tingly inside...
Ar - Yep, this is what sex is. 
Ar - Do you like it, Ember?
Em - Ahhh... I don't... know...
Em - Don't stop, Arron.
Arron felt like something in Ember's tone changed, having a mature hint not being present previously.
Em - Yes... This feels great...
Em - I can feel you inside my body.
Ar - Ember...?
Em - Please, keep moving...
=ABG ember_miss_4=
Ember acted unlike her usual self, but at this point, Arron has lost any will to question anything.
Em - Ah... I'm feeling it coming...
Em - Closer, Arron...
Without giving him any time to react, Ember strongly embraced him to her chest.
Em - Yess... Just a bit... 
Em - You’re cumming... as well... right?
Just when Arron considered pulling out, Ember's legs coiled around his waist, pushing him deeper inside her.

Em - Oh, I'm sorry! I've grabbed you without thinking.
Em - Sir Arron, are you alright?
Ar - It's been worse.
Em - Oh.. I'm sorry.
Ar - Don't worry, it felt great.
Em - Really? It was super great for me as well!
Ar - (Hmm I could've sworn something was different just a moment ago.)
Ar - (Was it just my imagination?)
Em - Can we do it one more time? Please!
Ar - ... 
Ar - Having it too easy like this will soon spoil me.
