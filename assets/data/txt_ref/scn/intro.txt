The Kingdom of Avior has been at peace for the last few centuries. Political stability felt almost taken for granted not only by the citizens, but even by royalty. 
Military successes of the previous king, Mizar, provided his family with a big and strong country, which rightfully ruled to this day.
His son and successor, Alcor, reinforced his father's achievements and continued his rulership.
As it happens in a monarchy, his first son, Norbert, prepared to take his place, given his father’s old age.
However, in his twenties, the second prince Arron is nothing but trouble to his family...

Ar - My Lady, it's a great honor for me to be invited into your bedroom.

Ar - I've been dreaming of this day since our last meeting, and my heart skipped once I'd noticed your beautiful lustful eyes on me this morning...
Lr - You and your flattering again... Gosh, why are you already naked?
Ar - And why aren't you? 
Lr - Oh my...

Arron recognized the signal his servant, Rose, was instructed to give. 
Ar(neutral) - (Uh-oh... This is bad.)
Ar - My sincerest apologies, my lady.
=SOUND doorlocked=
Ar(neutral) - ... Huh?
Ar(shock) - The balcony door is stuck? 
Lr - Oh, it completely slipped my mind.
Lr - Norbert had jammed the door after last time.
Ar(neutral) - ......... Shit.

Norbert and a few guards barge into the room. As he sees his naked wife, rage quickly engulfs his face.
Nt(anger) - Where is he?! 
Lr - Dear, what are you doing? I had been taking a nap so nicely. Why have you brought these people into our love nest?
Nt(anger) - Check all the cabinets, and look under the bed!
Guard - There's nothing under the bed, m'lord. 
Guard2 - Cabinets are empty as well.
Guard3 - Balcony is not opening.
Nt(anger) - No way! He couldn't have gotten away again, keep looking.
Lr - Hmph, if only you were as zealous at night as you are right now. 
*chuckle*
Nt(anger) - What the... 
Guard - Behind the door!
Ar - There's nobody here!
Nt(anger) - ARRON!!
Ar(neutral) - ...
Ar - I know how it looks, but it wasn't me.
Ar(shock) - Ouch, stop dragging me, I can walk on my own!

Arron, with his hands tied behind his back sits on the floor of a large cell. Norbert observes him, while his subordinates prepare for a ritual.
Rose hides among the shadows of a far corner, unnoticed.
Nt - You know, it was funny when you convinced the Pope that Aunt Mary had been possessed by the devil so he performed a whole ceremony for her. 
Ar - Everyone knows old people are evil. That's why they are still with us and not with God.
Nt - ...it also was rather amusing when you brought a bunch of homeless people to our dining hall during the negotiations with Reines and insisted that you will become their king in a new nation.
Ar - Bob could also replace me as a King. 
Nt - You are not taking this seriously, are you? Tell me, were you really not satisfied with all those palace maids and feudal daughters? Why go after my wife? 
Ar - Dunno, you went for her for some reason. You don't know either?
Nt(anger) - THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON!? Because she's MY wife?
Ar - Nah, she also seemed quite delighted with my company. I mean, how can you ignore someone who eagerly woos you?
Nt(anger) - Shut the hell up, I'm not going to hear from you that my wife is unfaithful. 
Ar(neutral) - Sure, it's all my fault.
Nt - Your wildness had been ignored by father way too many times.
Ar - Hah. So what you gonna do? You can't kill or imprison me. Everyone will realize you did it, and the people won't like it. 
Nt - True. Even though many nobles find your behavior displeasing, killing you isn’t really worth it. You have to disappear.
Ar(neutral) - ... What? This is what you are preparing?
=BG scenes/dungeon_2 0.5=
As they kept talking, a number of magical runes across the floor began to glow. 
Nt - Yes and we are about to finish. This portal spell will send you where you won't be causing us any more troubles ever again. 
Arron's eyes widened with surprise and disbelief.
Ar(neutral) - (Uh, shit, he seems to actually be serious this time.)
Ar(shock) - Hey, stop it, Norb, father will know! 
Nt - Nobody will know, and the nobles will confirm that you just disappeared during the night. Everyone will be happier without you around.

Nt - Farewell, Arron, you were a huge pain in the ass all these years. 
Portal runes shine with incredible brightness when Rose runs out of hiding, trying to push Arron away from it.
Ar(shock) - Rose? What the... 
=SPRITE_FADE 0.5=

=SOUND teleport=
Just as she enters the circle, the spell completes, the light fading, and revealing the empty space where once was two people.
Nt - Huh... was that his slave? Well, one less witness to worry about. Clean it all up, I'll prepare to make a report for father.

In the middle of an empty desert two bodies appear on the ground.
Ar(neutral) - Ouch... Damn it, Rose you are an idiot! 
Ro(sad) - Ugh. What is this place? Where are we? 
Ar(neutral) - Hell if I know. Untie me already.
Arron barely managed to get up with his hands still tied behind his back.
Rose frees Arron from the ropes.

Ro(sad) - I'm sorry, Master... I just... couldn't hold back.
Ar(neutral) - Forget it. Now, what is this place?
The pairtakes a long look at their surroundings, finding only desert and rocks. 
Ar(neutral) - Shit, I really shouldn't have slept during those geography lessons.
Ar(neutral) - Norb will really pay for this once I get back.
Ar - First I'll have to take care of those suspicious guys with him...
Ro - I think it will be better if we start moving.
Ar - Yeah, it doesn’t seem like anyone will be coming to help us any time soon. Let's go.
Ro - Where to? 
Ar(neutral) - Hrm...
Ar - Anywhere! I'm free now, so I can go anywhere I want, Mwahaha!
Ro - (Despite the situation, looks like Master has returned to his normal mood pretty quick. That's a relief...)

Ro - Hmmm... It was midnight when we were at the castle, but it’s noon here, that must mean...
Ar - Time travel! 
Ro(sarcastic) - No, we must be very far away from the kingdom.
Ar(neutral) - Bullshit, you’re telling me time travel isn't real now?
Ro - It never was...
Ar(shock) - So I’ll never be able to become my own grandfather? 
Ro(sarcastic) - ...Thankfully.

After days worth of walking, and losing hope, Arron and Rose come across a small, poor settlement.
Ro(shock) - Look, Master, a goblin village!
Ar(neutral) - Looks more like a dunghole to me.
Ro - We haven't seen any people for 2 days... Let's check it out at least.
Ar(neutral) - Fine, whatever.
Arron calls for the attention of a single goblin who does not seem surprised by his appearance.

Ar(neutral) - Hey you, what is this place? 
G - What does it look like to you? We live here.
Ro - This place does not look very comfortable to live in. But where is it located? Maybe you can show us on a map? If you have one around?
G - Do I look like I ever went anywhere else? And what’s a map? 
Ro - ...
Ar(neutral) - Yet, you don't look very surprised by us. 
G - Freaking big deal. Adventurers come and go all the time. Some even stay and leech off our food.
Ar - Curious, and whose domain is this? 
G - Eh? We don't belong to anyone since nobody really cares about this land. 
G - This place might look like a dump, but it's totally independent. 
Ar(shock) - What? Who governs you then? You don't even have a leader?
G - No. I told just you that...
Hearing that Arron's eyes quickly shine with fervor.
Ar - You heard it? These savages need a governor!
Ro(sarcastic) - With all respect, I don't think you will be able to lead...
Ar - Tell me, friend, do you know the benefits of having someone to organize and take care of town's problems?

After becoming the settlement's mayor, Arron and Rose moved into the best available house.
Ar - See that? And they were saying democracy is a mistake.
Ro(sarcastic) - (Makes me realize why)
Ro(talk) - I must say, this is a rather nice living space.
Ro(talk) - Oh, and we also have our first visitor today.
Ar - People want to meet their new leader. Let's not keep them waiting. Bring them in.
A shabby looking goblin casually walks in, disinterestedly looking around.
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
=DELAY 0.5=
G - Oi, Governor, since you are responsible for the village now, Flak from market asks you to visit him.
Ar(neutral) - (No manners at all, huh)
Ar(neutral) - Why did he not visit himself?
G - He is busy, I guess. Just don't take too long.
=SPRITE_FADE 0.5=
=DELAY 0.5=
The goblin disappears, leaving Arron mildly baffled. 
Ar(neutral) - You bring him here then. 
Ro(sarcastic) - I'm afraid he won't agree to follow me. We can't order them around just like that. 
Ar(neutral) - ...
Ar(neutral) - Democracy was a mistake.

Ro - I've finished asking around.
Ro - It seems there's no known info about Avior, or where it even might be. 
Ar - You made sure not to give away where we came from, right? 
Ro - Yes. Thankfully, there's plenty of adventurers passing by around here, often anonymously. 
Ro - Anyway, these lands are called Vienar. 
Ar(neutral) - Never heard of such a name. 
Ro - Me neither. 
Ro - Most of civilization seems to be run by independent city-states, who seem to trade and share frequently, but most oppose each other on some political level. 
Ro - But, our village lies somewhat distant from most other cities, hence why there's little interest in this place.
Ar - So... that means we can stay here safely?
Ro - That also means we have no idea how to get back.
Ro(sarcastic) - Wait, master, are you actually planning to return? 
Ar - Hm... Maybe.
Ro(talk) - What!? We can't stay here for the rest of our lives. 
Ar - Why not?
Ro(sarcastic) - Aren’t you going to miss your family? Your royal life?
Ar - Well, I have to get revenge on Norb, don't I.
Ar - Relax, I'm just kidding. I guess our only option to get back is how we got here. We’re gonna need some skilled mages. 
Ro - That already might prove to be a challenge. From what passing adventurers said, teleportation magic doesn’t seem to be common around here.
Ar - Well, all the more reason to make sure our position here is nice and stable.
Ar - Plus when else am I going to get the chance to rule anyone but mere servants?
