Ar - Hmm, what's up with the commotion? 
Ro - I'm not sure. Looks like someone popular is paying us a visit?
Ar - Hey you, what's going on?

G - What, are you some country bumpkin? It's the Ancestral Cult's priest. 
Ar - What cult?
Ro - Ancestral Cult. They are the most popular religious group around here. It seems even goblins hold them in high regards.
Ar - I see. Anyway, what's up with the disrespect? Don't you know I'm your mayor?
G - Whatever, dumbass. I didn't vote for you. 
=SPRITE_FADE 0.5=
The goblin defiantly walks away from Arron. 
Ar - That bastard... Rose, we should build a jail. And maybe institute new laws to punish disrespectful folk.
Ro(sarcastic) - Maybe we should see why this priest came by instead? You know, as your duty as mayor.
Ar - Fine. But I refuse to treat him seriously on the inside. 
Ro - Maybe you should, given he probably has more authority here than you.

D - ...This is why you should always keep your eyes open and report any suspicious activities.
D - Hmm? You must be the new ruler of this village. My name is Demitrius. Pleased to meet you.
Ro - This is the Mayor, Sir Arron. And my name is Rose. We are pleased to meet you as well.
Ar - Hmm? What were you talking about just now?
D - This is my mission, to explain to everyone the danger of Demons.

D - Despite how peaceful this world might look to you, there are evil beings we call Demons, who always aim to invade and destroy all that is good for us.
Ar - Seems nasty. Why would they do this?
D - They feed on the world's life energy and since their world has become a barren wasteland, they have been attempting to come here for centuries.
Ro - What do they look like?
D - They take many forms, but mostly they disguise themselves as sentient beings. This is why you should be especially careful around any strangers.
D -  They might lie about how they lost their memory or came from some other world, but our interrogations have shown it all to be lies.
D - Anyone, looking suspicious or having appeared from nowhere should be reported to Ancestral Cult immediately. 
D - So we are doing our best to keep the peace. 
Ro - *Gulp*
Ar - You are doing God's work, Demitrius, we'll make sure to contact you immediately. 
Ar - If that's the only thing you've came for, we can do our best to help you with supplies on your way back.
D - I'm glad you asked. In fact, I have a cult's mission on my shoulders, I'd be pleased to have your help. 
Ar - What could it be?
D - There has been a report about an unknown artifact located in some nearby caverns. Sometimes such things appear in our world and if it's connected to Demons, it's my job to ensure it's harmless.
D - As you can see, I'm no fighter, so your escort would be greatly appreciated.
Ro - (With all respect, I think it would be best for us to refuse this task.)
G - Of course our mayor will gladly help you out, Father. He often skirmishes outside and can handle himself in battle.
Ar - ... I guess we should've hurried with enacting those new laws.
Ar - I mean, we gladly will help you out, Father Demitrius.
D - I'm glad to know this village is so high spirited. Once you prepare, I'll be waiting for you at the exit.

As Dimitrus goes slightly behind the group, Rose talks to the Arron.
Ro - We are in a tight spot here. 
Ro - If our origin goes public, they will certainly proclaim us to be demons.
Ar - Relax, he does not seem to suspect anything.
Ar - Once we are done with his task, he's going to leave and it will be all good.
Ro - I suppose...
Ro - The villagers do seem to pay him great respect though.
Ro - Thankfully, it does not seem like they actually believe in this whole demon idea.
Er - Of course it's all nonsense.
Ro(shock) - EH? You were listening all this time?
Er(happy) - Don't worry, my lips are shut.
Er - Unless you are interested in my oral skills.
Ro - *Sigh* Let's just get this over with.

The team arrives at the dark room with a small, generic box placed on a ruined altar.

D - Yes, this seems to be the thing from my reports. 
D - You have my deep gratitude, Arron. 
Ar(neutral) - It's been a pleasure.
Demitrius approaches and closely inspects the box.
As he removes the lid, a thick fog bursts out and fills the room.
Em - Ah!
Ar(shock) - What the...
D - Curses!

D - You must take me for a fool if you think you can delude me with your lies.

Ar - Hmmm... Can't we talk this over? 
Em(tired) - We are not demons. And sir Arron is a good person!
D - Foolish. Even if you are not a demon, you are still being controlled by them.
D - You can't be trusted.
D - This is your last chance, surrender immediately!
Ar - Hmph. You are no fighter, you said so yourself.
Ar - What are you going to do? Preach us to sleep?
At those words, a round item came flying from Demitrius falling a few steps away from Arron.
Ro(shock) - Ah!
