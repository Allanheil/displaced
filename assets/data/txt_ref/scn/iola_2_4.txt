The team ended up in a jail building near one of the cells.
Ri - It's here.
Ar - This is quite a sturdy door.
Ar - Ember, could you?
Em - Alright!
=SOUND crash=
=SPRITE iola=
I - Sir Arron!?
Ar - I prefer "Prince Charming" at times like this.
Ro(sarcastic) - Ha-ha.
Ar(neutral) - What have you been doing here?
I(sad) - Father imprisoned me but I'm not sure why.
I(sad) - He's been acting weird and I eavesdropped on his guest.
Ar - Curious, but I think it would be better if we leave first.
Ar - Your colleagues don't seem very friendly either.
I(sad) - No, I can't.
I - It's father's order so there should be some reason.
Ar(neutral) - Look, your father locked you in a jail like this.
Ar(neutral) - Even if he's not psycho, you won't make things better by staying here.
Ro - Plus he ordered the guards to attack us. 
Ro - It's not sane to stay here.
I(sad) - No, this must be some mistake.
I - I'm sure he can understand if I talk to him.
However, the armed group gathered on the other side of the hall.
Guard - We cornered them! 
Guard - Archers, ready!
Guard2 - But Lady Iola is there.
Guard - Damnit, did these bastards plan this out?
=SPRITE demitrius=
D - Shoot. 
Guard - Eh?! 
Guard - But Father, there's your daughter in the cell.
I - Please wait!
D - She was brainwashed by the foul demons.
D - There's no other choice. 
I(shock) - Wha!...
Guard - ...Yes, Sir.
Guard - Shoot!
Ro(shock) - No!
Ar(anger) - !..
=BG scenes/rilu_defend=
*Splurt*
Ri - Ugh...
Before arrows hit their target, Rilu jumped in front of them, shielding others with her body.
I - Rilu?!
I - NO!
Ar - Ember!
Em - Yes? 
Ar - Bust an opening so we can escape.
Ar - Erika, take Rilu, I'll grab Iola.
Er - Gotcha.
D - What are you waiting for, idiots? Shoot again!
Guard - Yes, si...

A shockwave and further trembling threw soldiers of balance making them unable to continue that attack.
Em - Oh.. I think it was a bearing wall.
Ar(anger) - The building is unstable. Run!
=SPRITE demitrius=
D - Damnit.
Guard - Your Highness, they are getting away. 
D - Really observant, you idiot.

I(sad) - Rilu, please do not die!
I(sad) - You protected us... *sob*
Ri - *cough* *cough*
I(shock) - Eh? She's alive!
Ri - Pull the arrow from my... *cough* lung.
Rilu stoically endured arrows being pulled out of her body.
I - You look like you are really in pain. Let me help you.
Ri - Don't worry, I'm used to it.
Ar - Weirdly enough she's immortal.
I - Oh... Thank goodness.
I(sad) - I can't believe my father ordered them to kill me...
I - I want to thank you all for my rescue.
I(sad) - I don't know what I should do now, though.
Ar - You are welcome to live with us. 
Ar - It's not fancy but folk here is pretty friendly.
Ar - I'm afraid your father won't be generous to us any time soon though. 
I(sad) - I don't know, I don't wanna be a bother to you.
Ar - Don't be stupid, we are glad to have more pretty gi... I mean companions around.
Ro - *Sigh*
Ar - Right, Rilu?
Ri - ...Why are you asking me?
Ar - Didn't you suggest the whole rescue thing in the first place?
Ri - ...
I - I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this.
Ri - That's fine.
Ro - I'll see where we can let you stay.
