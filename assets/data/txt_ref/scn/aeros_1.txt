Ar - Oh jeez, not the guards...
Em - Hey, Rose, why doesn’t sir Arron like the guards?
Ro - It's probably since they mostly had to keep him in place.
Ar - Far from it, but you can also count that.
Guard - Halt. Where are you going?
Ar - Can we go in?
Guard - Hmmm... Are you a citizen?
Ar - No. We are sorta on a delivery here?
Guard - I don't trust you. The city is off-limits if you aren’t a citizen. 
Guard - We don't need a new group of beggars on the streets.
Ar(neutral) - You gotta be shitting me. Do I look like a beggar?
Guard - No pass.
Ar - Listen, guard...
Guard - I have a name, and it's Carl.
Ar - ......
Ar - Listen, Carl, we really need to go in, how can we prove we aren't beggars?
Guard - Hmph. Perhaps a small payment of 10,000 gold will prove it. For each person.
Ar(anger) - YOU FU...
Ro - Wait, Sir Carl, we really need to get inside. Could you please consider some other way? We are willing to do anything!
Guard - Heh... Anything you say? 
Ro(sarcastic) - .....Except that.
Guard - Hmph. 
Guard - ...
Guard - Fine, there's been a lot of reports about bloodthirsty dwarves coming out from nearby caves. 
Guard - If you take care of them, I will consider allowing you to pass.
Ar - Sigh.. let's just get on with it.
Ar - Now you see why I hate guards, Ember.
Ro - Now that you mention it, I can relate.
Ro - Maybe we could let Erika please him though.
Er - Boo. Like I would cheat on Arron like that.
