Ar - ...Doesn't feel right to leave her as is.

Arron followed Rilu until she entered Summerhill Keep as she carefully avoided any stray undead.
However, after a couple of rooms he lost a sight of her.
Ar(neutral) - Shit, where did she go.
Ar - Maybe coming like that into an undead ruin wasn't a good idea after all.
Arron's thoughts were stopped by a loud noise from one of the halls.
Ar(shock) - Damnit, what the...
A couple of undeads appeared rushing to the direction of noise, but spotting Arron.
