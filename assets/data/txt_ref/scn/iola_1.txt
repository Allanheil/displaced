Ro - There seems to be a new traveler in the village. She's looking for an audience.

I - Hello, Sir Arron. I'm Iola from Ancestral Cult. 
Ar - (Wow, she seems pretty hot. Maybe we'll be able to settle Demitrius disappearance without causing too much of a commotion.)
Ar - Pleased to meet you. The Ancestral cult is quite popular among the villagers. 
Ar - What brings you here?
I - You see, it's about my father...
Ro - ...
Ar - ...
I - He seems to have visited your village a few days ago but hasn't returned after that.
Ar - Oh, so you are Demitrius' daughter? Yes, we indeed had him visit us, but...
Ar - (Ugh... What do I say to her now...)
Ro - We escorted him to his target, but haven't seen him since then.
Ar - Yes, he made us leave. We had no idea no one had seen him since then.
Ar - The roads around are rather dangerous, but I hope he's fine.
I - I see, this is not like my father to go missing without telling me first.
I - I have a favor to ask, sir Arron, can you please show me where you left him?
Ar(neutral) - (Darn... I can't even refuse her since we were the only people last seen him.)
Ar(neutral) - (But if anything happens to her, it's a gigantic red flag. The cult won't let 2 of its members disappear near us without serious investigation.)
Ar - Of course, we will surely do our best. Just give us time to prepare.
I - I'm glad to hear that, sir Arron, I'm sure the Ancestors will bless your helpfulness.

Ro - Are we really doing this? You are going to show her her father's corpse?
Ar - If you have nothing better to complain about, shut up and practice your shocked reaction.
Ar - Darn... and she's a beauty, what a chance slipping by because of her dumbass father. 
Ro - ...That's all you can think about?
Ar - Well excuse me, thinking about dead old men is a worse alternative here.

Ar - Well, last time it was somewhere around here.

I - Father!

The tall familiar figure appears from the far corner of the cave room. 
Iola rushes and hugs her father.
Ar - ...
Ro(shock) - Holy!...
Ar - Huh... I guess practicing your shock reaction wasn't really necessary. 
D - Iola, what are you doing here?
I - I've come searching for you! What were you doing here for so long?
D - Hm... I must have lost in thoughts and time flew by without me noticing. 
D - I'm sorry about that. Let's go home.
Without raising any suspicion Demitrius moved to the room's exit.

After leaving the caves Demitrius gives no apparent interest to Arron's party and left them with his daughter.
Ro - But how can this be? Maybe he actually did survive?
Ar - I don't think anyone survives having half of his head smashed to pieces.
Ro - ...
Em - But isn't it great this all ended well? It doesn't seem like he remembers what happened. 
Ar - That's true. See Rose, you should be more optimistic like Ember. 
Ro - No-no, this is certainly not right.
Er - Maybe it was just an illusion or a dream? 
Ar - I don't really care at this point. I've missed my opportunity of getting closer with Iola so let's go back.
Er(happy) - Arron is on point as ever.
