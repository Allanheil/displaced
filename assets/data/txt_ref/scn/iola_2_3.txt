The group has entered the Cult's temple grounds. 
Ar - Huh... This organization seems rather abundant. 
Ar - So, do you think we'll be able to pass through without causing ruckus?
Guard - Hey, stop right there!
Guard2 - Hey, it's those guys we've been told about.
Guard - Shit, don't let them get away!
Ar - Looks like we are expected.
Ro(sarcastic) - That's not a good thing.
Ar - Why are you so pessimistic? 
Ar - Maybe they just wanna show us around.
Ro(sarcastic) - Yeah, judging on how they charge at us armed, it will be their prison they want us to see.
