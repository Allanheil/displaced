Em - I see you found some unusual wood up there. Please, let me have it!
Ar - Hmh... sure. What's so unusual about it?
Em - Oh, I can use it to make items with special properties. 
Ar - You can do that? You are pretty useful after all.
Em - Ha-ha, You are so kind, Sir Arron! I can also cook scrambled eggs! 
Ar - That's amazing. What are those properties anyway?
Em - Depends on the material used, it can make you stronger, faster... stuff like that.
Ar - Ho-oh. Can it make my wood stronger? 
Em - Huh? Your wood? You are not a human?
Ar - Nah, I'm actually a half-ent. 
Em(happy) - REALLY?!
Ro(sarcastic) - Please, don't trust everything people say.
Ar - But I do have wood, occasionally, maybe you could help with it.
Em - I don't quite understand, but sure!
Ro(sarcastic) - He lies to you, he has no lumber. 
Ar(neutral) - Tsk... I've trusted you, Rose. Such a brutish move from you. 
Em(tired) - Uh... I still don't understand, but in either case, if you find any more rare materials, make sure to bring them to me!
Ar - Aren't I'm one of a kind? 
Ro - Please, stop.
