Ar - Hmmm... Can't we talk this over?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_0
Em(sad) - We are not demons. And sir Arron is a good person! & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_1
D(talk) - Foolish. Even if you are not a demon, you are still being controlled by them. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_2
D - You can't be trusted. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_3
D(talk) - This is your last chance, surrender immediately! & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_4
Ar(neutral) - Hmph. You are no fighter, you said so yourself. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_5
Ar - What are you going to do? Preach us to sleep? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_6
At those words, a round item came flying from Demitrius falling a few steps away from Arron. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_7

Em(sad) - Ah... He should've listened. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_22
Ro - *Gulp* & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_23
Ar(shock) - What the hell... He's dead now. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_24
Er - That's unfortunate, but you can't blame yourself for that.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_25
Em - What are we gonna do now? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_26
Ro - We probably should take care of his body... & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_27
Em - Sir Arron, there's like a dozen golems coming! & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_28
Ar(neutral) - Shit, they must have been agitated by the explosions. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_29

Ro - But won't he be missed...? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_32
The party agreed to not bring up this incident around the settlement and if anyone would ask, they brought him to the caves and left him alone. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_4_33
