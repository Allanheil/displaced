Ar - Hmmm... Can't we talk this over? 
Em(sad) - We are not demons. And sir Arron is a good person!
D(talk) - Foolish. Even if you are not a demon, you are still being controlled by them.
D - You can't be trusted.
D(talk) - This is your last chance, surrender immediately!
Ar(neutral) - Hmph. You are no fighter, you said so yourself.
Ar - What are you going to do? Preach us to sleep?
At those words, a round item came flying from Demitrius falling a few steps away from Arron.
Ro(shock) - Ah!

*Bam*
The cave walls shook at the heavy explosion with dust falling to the ground.
Ar(shock) - What the hell was that? A bomb?
D(talk) - Do not underestimate the Ancestral Cult, you foul creatures.

A large chunk of stone has broken off from the ceiling and fell onto Demitrius.

Demitrius died as a huge rock stuck his head.

Em(sad) - Ah... He should've listened.
Ro - *Gulp*
Ar(shock) - What the hell... He's dead now.
Er - That's unfortunate, but you can't blame yourself for that. 
Em - What are we gonna do now?
Ro - We probably should take care of his body...
Em - Sir Arron, there's like a dozen golems coming!
Ar(neutral) - Shit, they must have been agitated by the explosions.
Ar(neutral) - There's no choice, let's retreat.

Ar(neutral) - This isn't good, but we can't tell anyone about this.
Ro - But won't he be missed...?
The party agreed to not bring up this incident around the settlement and if anyone would ask, they brought him to the caves and left him alone.
