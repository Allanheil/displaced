Meanwhile Iola had finished her routine and was preparing to go to Arron again.
I - Phew, almost done here.
I - I should warn father, that I'm leaving.
She took a peek at her father's office before entering.
I - Huh, he seems to receive guests...

D - So you got rid of that dwarf king?
=SPRITE victor=
V - Sort of, wasn't me, but I finished the bastard.
D - Wasn't you?
V - Yeah, it seems like that guy got to him first.
D - I thought I ordered you to keep your eyes on him, idiot.
V - Whatever, from this world or not, he's no match for me.
V - I can kill him any time I want. 
D - That's not what I ordered.
D - Maybe we can use him to do our job.
V - Your job.
D - It will be your job if you fuck this up. 
V - *grunt*
D - Now get lost already, it's not good if we are seen here together here.
V - Oh is it? You probably should take care of peeping toms next time. 
D - Huh?
Before Iola realized it, the door in front of her was forced in and she was dragged inside.
I(shock) - What?! 
I(shock) - Let me go now! 
I(shock) - Father! What-
*Thud*
=SOUND punch=
V - Hell, I hate women.
V - Always so noisy.
D - Don't dare kill her. 
D - Shit, now I have to sort this out too...
