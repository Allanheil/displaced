Ro - This place looks so bizzare. 
Ro - Everything is made out of stone, but it’s crumbling.
Ri(talk) - Looks like it was a human city before it was brought here. 
Er - I could never imagine a city like that.
Ri - Probably built with some advanced magic or technologies.
Ar - I'd be more worried about what we're gonna meet here. 
Ar(neutral) - Wouldn't like to repeat my last encounter.

D - How do you like my work? 
Ro(talk) - This is terrible. Why would you do this?
D - Don't be so boring.
D - When else would you be able to see something so different to your insipid lives?
Ar(neutral) - Pardon my insipidness, but we're going to stop you.
D - Hahaha, that's a funny joke. 
D - You fight for this world, but it's a lost cause.
D - I really like your persistence, but look at yourself.
D - You guys are the only ones who actually came. 
Ar(neutral) - But it was you, who made locals indifferent to their future. 
D - Bullshit. It's just your nature. 
D - To be cattle for us. 
Ar(anger) - Getting really sick of your arrogance.

Ar - Getting cold feet now? 
D - Don't make me laugh-
Without hesitation Arron charged at Dimitrius
=SPRITE_HIDE=
But he teleported at the last moment a few feet into the air.
Ar(neutral) - Tsk.
D - Let me show something really cool.
Ro - Huh? 
A sound of distant explosions shook the air.
As they turned the way it came from, they could see a small object flying through the air.
Er - Look!
Ar(shock) - Shit, dodge!
Before Arron noticed, Dimitrius had escaped, observing them from a safe distance.
=SPRITE demitrius=
=SOUND explosion=
An explosion of insane power erupted on top of the square where he just fought.
D - Hahaha! 
D - These toys are really something.
D - How did you like this tactical nuke, Arron?
D - Ah, I guess you can't answer anymore.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Ar - Shit... Everyone alright?
Ro(talk) - Yes, we've got pushed underground by the blast.
Ro - Iola shielded us in the last moment.

Ar(shock) - Iola?
Ri(talk) - She's fine, just exhausted.
Ar(neutral) - Alright, we need some time to rest.
Em(tired) - But what should we do now? 
Em(tired) - We can't beat him like this.
Ar(neutral) - Well, he must think we are dead.
Ar(neutral) - Means we have some time to think about it.

Er - Hey, I found the exit to the sewers.

The group entered a small building filled with books and unknown devices.
=SPRITE caliban=
Ro(shock) - Ah!
C - Ah. 
Ar(shock) - It's Zelroth's minion!
C - Oh, it's you guys.
Ri - He looks somewhat different.
Ar(neutral) - You are not going to fight us?
C - No, I'd rather not.
Ar - You also talk differently.
Ar - Where's Zelroth then?
C - He's no more. I've absorbed his intelligence. 
C - Must thank you for that opportunity. 
Ro(talk) - But what are you doing here then? 
C - Studying. I've been having an unusual thirst for knowledge recently. 
C - Humans here had a really advanced understanding of the world and nature.
Ar(neutral) - Well, if you aren't going to fight we should move on.
C - ....Hold on. 
C - Are you still planning to fight Dimitrius?
Ar - Do we look like we have any other option?
C - You hardly have any chances on your own at his current power.
Ar - So what, do you suggest we  give up?
C - No, I actually want to offer you some help.
Ro - Why? How do we even trust you?
C - I'm not one of them and it's only a matter of time after they finish you off that they get to me.
C - And they are not going to like what I did.
C - Between you and the demons I'd clearly prefer your dominance.
Ar(neutral) - Fair enough, I don't mind letting you go free.
Ar(neutral) - As long as you aren't going to repeat Zelroth's deeds. Caliban, was it?
C - No, actually I've chosen a new name for me. Now I'm Cyrex.
Ar - Alright, Cyrex, so what can you offer.
C - I'm not going to help you personally, but there still might be a way to defeat Dimitrius.
C - Although, it's not going to be simple at all.
Ar - Something is better than nothing.
C - Good. Then, you must be aware that demons are weak to light.

D - Fine, I'll play with you for the last time, Arron.
*snap*
A number of demon minions jumped from the outside into the building. 
Ar(anger) - Gh...
D - Go after them!
D - Now I made you look like an idiot. Ahaha!
Ar(neutral) - We'll see about that, asshole.
Saying that, Arron turned his back and ran away.

Meanwhile Rose and Erika moved through the lab’s upper floors.

Er - Or so I was told anyway.
Ro(talk) - Please, we are in a dire situation here.

Rose and Erika entered the room filled with glowing glass screens.
Er - Alright, it's your turn.
Ro - Uh... This might take some time.
Er - You sure you can manage it?
Ro(sarcastic) - No, it would help if you could help me out too.
Er - You know I'm too stupid for this stuff.
Ro - ...Just let Rilu know we got there. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Meanwhile Arron kept escaping from Dimitrius.
After making through another room he ended up in a small room connected to a giant curved structure.
Without taking a pause he opened a small hatch and jumped inside, sealing it shut behind him.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=

=SPRITE demitrius=
Right as he finished, Dimitrius predictably appeared next to him. 
=SOUND slash=
Arron attempted to land a surprise attack, but Dimitrius blocked it.
Ar(anger) - Damn you.
D - It seems your brilliance is finally overshadowed by your human nature.
D - What a stupid thing to trap yourself in this place even though I can easily  teleport.
Dimitrius was correct, they appeared to be inside of an isolated curving tunnel only spacious enough to allow one person running in it.
Ar(anger) - ...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=BG future_city_reactor=
=SPRITE rilu=
Meanwhile Ember, Rilu and Iola ran from the other side of the tunnel. 
Ri - Ember, give it to me.
Em - Sure.
Ember passed Rilu a small piece of red cloth that she managed to rip off Dimitrius' outfit during the fight.
Ri - Erika said they got to the control room as well.
Ri - Iola, you can start making your preparations.
I - Got it!
=SPRITE demon=

After a few clashes Dimitrius has managed to strike Arron's sword from his hands.
Ar(shock) - Ah!
D - And it's over.
Ar(anger) - Like hell it is!
Taken by surprise, Dimitrius was attacked by barehanded Arron, throwing him on the ground.
=SOUND tumble=
What he didn't see is how Arron pulled the shock baton out of his clothes.
D(anger) - What the-
=SOUND shocker=
Bzzzzt
D(anger) - Arrggh... You bastard...
As the baton was connected to Dimitrius body, electrical shock ran through his body completely immobilizing and depowering him to the point he couldn't speak easily.
Ar - Hah, so it does work on you after all. 
D(anger) - You... Will pay for this...
Arron kept Dimitrius in one spot as electrical current continued to restrict him.
Ar(neutral) - You know what really gets on my nerves? 
D(anger) - You are... just postponing the inevitable...
Ar(neutral) - It's your trash attitude towards us. 
D(anger) - You still... can't kill me...
Ar(neutral) - Humans aren't the animals you take us for.
D(anger) - And once energy... runs out...
Ar(neutral) - I actually believe we can achieve great things.
D(anger) - You will... fucking die...
Ar(neutral) - You aren't even listening. 
Ar - Well, at least you won't tell it to others.

Ro - Master, please be safe.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=SPRITE rilu=

Rilu began to chant the spell, as lights around the structure began to work.

=SPRITE demitrius=
As Arron kept Dimitrius disabled, he sensed how the mechanisms around him went into motion and small lights turned on.
Ar(neutral) - It seems I don't have much time left. 
D - ...Hah... starting to regret... your arrogance?
Ar(neutral) - I've heard that demons hate light. 
D(anger) - (Keep talking fool, I only need a bit more to break free)
Ar - You might have no idea, but this weird place is called a fusion reactor. 
D(anger) - Watcha... talking about...
Ar - Amazingly, it is able to eminate the power of the Sun itself.
Ar - Given your condition, it seems my shocker has nearly run out of power. 
Ar - So, say, do you think you will be able to survive fifty millions degree heat?
D - Enough!
Dimitrius pushed Arron away with a slowly returning power, still oblivious to what was going on around him. 
=SOUND fall=
Ar(shock) - Behind!
Realizing that Arron indeed saw something behind him, Dimitrius looked around to find a huge cloud of forming plasma spreading through the reactor's coil.
In the same moment Arron disappeared from his previous place.
D(anger) - ...Teleportation?
D - You fool, did you forget who I am?
D - ...
D(anger) - Huh?
D(anger) - Something stops me? 
D(anger) - HOW!?

Ar(shock) - I-
Ro(talk) - Master, isn't it fine? We have to return home soon anyway.
Ar(neutral) - ......
Ar(neutral) - Whatever. But how do you plan to do it? Dimitrius is gone now.
I - Umh, I think I've some of those powers, when he died I felt like they went into me. 
I(sad) - Maybe because we were related.
I - I think I'll be able to transfer you back to your world.
