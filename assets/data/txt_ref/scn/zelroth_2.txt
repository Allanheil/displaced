C - Master defeated! I run!
Big monster quickly escapes in one of the halls leaving Zelroth laying on the floor.
Ar(neutral) - Wait!
=SPRITE rilu=
Ri - Ignore it, we don't need him.
Z - Even after you kill me... 
Z -  Dimitrius will get you...
Ri - Shut up, I'm not going to kill you.
Rilu proceeded to inspect Zelroth's possessions.
Ri - Found it.
Ar(neutral) - Uh, are we really going to use this?
Ri - I don't see any other options on hand.
Ar - ...Fine, I'll trust this to you.
Ri - Let's return then.

Behind the iron bars of the jail, Rose sits out in the cold.
Ro - ...
Ro - How do I even get out of this?
Ro - Life was so simple back then...

? - Poor thing... Losing her parents at such a young age.
?? - You mean last week's fire? 
?? - That was fierce.
? - She’s been in shock since then and barely says anything. Only sobs.
? - She has no relatives around here, we're gonna have to find her an orphanage.
Woman - I'll be taking care of her.
Woman - I knew her parents.
? - You must have a really kind heart, miss.
Woman - Hey, you are Rose, right? 
Woman - Do you want to be friends with me?
Ro - .....

Woman - Good morning, Rose. 
Woman - How are you feeling today?
Ro - I'm good, thanks.
Rose smiled. 
It's been a few months since the incident and she grew accustomed to her new life.
Woman - Today we go for a walk. Make sure to clean your face. 
Ro - *nod*

Slavetrader - She's just a child, and untrained one. 
Slavetrader - You will not get a lot of money from me for her.
Slavetrader - I'll have to smuggle her somewhere far away, so at least her breed will net some worth.
Woman - It's fine. 
Woman - She's an orphan and there's no other relatives.
Woman - Plus I don't want to raise  her any further, I've wasted quite a sum ofmoney on her food already.
Rose didn't realize what they were talking about, but since that day she never saw that woman again.

Slavetrader - What about this one? Looks pretty interesting at least.
Slavetrader2 - Yeah, but she's a failure. 
Slavetrader2 - After we tried to train her she just became like this.
Slavetrader2 - Barely reacts to anything, always has the eyes of a dead fish. 
Slavetrader - Won't even wag her tail, like they usually do, huh?
Slavetrader2 - Yeah, a shame. 
Slavetrader2 - It happens rarely, so we basically got unlucky.
Slavetrader2 - Don't think anyone would want to buy a slave like that. 
Slavetrader - We might have to dispose of her soon then.

Rose sat on the floor of a small cage, placed in a deserted part of a building. 
She had a visitor. A young, luxuriously clothed boy of her age.
Boy - Hey.
Boy - What's your name?
Ro - .....
Boy - Hey, you heard me. 
Boy - What's your name?
Boy - Why aren't you responding?
Ro - ...What is it?
Boy - I'm wondering what's your name.
Ro - ...It's Rose. 
Ro - Now leave me alone.
Boy - No. 
Ro - ....
Boy - Why are you telling me to leave you alone?
Ro - Are you stupid? I want to be left alone.
Boy - You're rude. 
Boy - So why do you want to be left alone?
Ro - Shut up! 
Ro - I just want to! Why are you so stupid?!
Boy - I'm not stupid. 
Boy - I have a name. 
Ro - And what’s your name? 
Boy - I won't tell you. 
Ro - Darn it, what do you even want!? 
Boy - Maybe I want you. 
Ro - Are you stupid? You're a child.
Boy - So are you.
Ro - I don't care. I don't want it.
Boy - Why?
Ro - Because I want to be left alone!
Boy - I don't believe you. 
Boy - And I don't care what you want. 
Ro - .....
Ro - Why are you even talking to me?
Boy - You are not like others. 
Boy - I like you. 
Ro - Wha..?
Boy - You don't act like you're desperate to please me.
Ro - You are weird. 
Boy - Got to go, see you soon. 
Ro - .....

? - Young master wants this girl?
? - I think it's better to pick someone who can be a better... caretaker? 
Boy - No. 
?? - You know that once Arron decides there's no turn back.
?? - Plus he refused to take anyone for 3 times straight.
Boy - It's your stupid rule how every royal member must have a personal servant.
?? - It's not MY rule, it's your family's rule. 
?? - This is how you get used to the-
Boy - I don't care.
? - Well, at least she's young so we can teach her literacy and penmanship. 
Boy - Are you done yet?
