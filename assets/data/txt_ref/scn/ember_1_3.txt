Em - Sir Arron, great to see you! What can I help you with?
Ar - I'm good. Just curious how you are doing.
Em - Oh, it's great here! And you visit me regularly too. 
Em - In the past people didn't seem to like having me around the village, but you seem so relaxed about it.
Ar - I'm a dragon's descendant just like you.
Em(happy) - What?! REALLY?
Ar - Maybe. 
Em - Oh... that might be true because you are not afraid of me.
Em - My appearance must be what repulses other people... Do you think I'll be able to find some place where I would be accepted?
Ar - Hmmm. True, people want to see something similar to them, rather than different. 
Em(sad) - Oh... this makes me sad. 
Ar - But you know what? You might still eventually pass for a human. 
Em - Oooh? I can? 
Ar - Naturally, you have some human characteristics, after all, I'm just not entirely sure how authentic they are.
Em(sad) - Uh... Sorry, I don't understand.
Ar - I'm saying that I'll need to investigate your body to see if you can pass for a human.
Em - OOOOH, Sir Arron, you can do this for me!? 
Ar - Well if you request it, it's my job to make sure everyone here is happy. 
Em - Okay, please! Let me just untie my apron.
Ar - (Darn.. this was way too easy, maybe later I should give her a couple of lessons about dignity)

Em - So, how is it?
Ar - Let's see.
Arron slowly circles around Ember.
Ar - You look rather healthy to me.
Em - I do? Master always said I heal very fast. 
Em - He did hit me a lot too, but I didn't feel much. It was kinda funny, ha-ha.
Ar - Is that so...
Arron grabbed one of Ember's tits and forcefully rubbed it.
=ABG ember_boobs_2 ember_boobs_3=
Em - Ah!
Ar - Did it hurt?
Em - N-no, it was just so sudden...
Ar - I see, softness seems to be rather good. 
*Pinch*
Em - A-ah!...
Ar - Hmm sensitivity seems to be good as well...
Ar - (Darn... I might be enjoying it too much)
Em - ...Sir Arron? 
Ar - Oh by the way, You don't really need to add 'Sir' for me.
Em - I don't?.. Ah!
Ar - Sorry, was it too rough? 
Em - No, it just... feels weird.
Ar - Mh-hm, this is a good sign. Very nice...

Ro - (What's even going on? They are doing it right here?)
Ro - (...Wow, Ember's are at least twice as big as mine!)
Ro - Master, what are you doing?!
Ar - What's up? Ember just asked me for help.
Ro - (Ember made a move on the Master!? I never expected that...)
Em - Oh Hey Rose. If you are in no hurry, give us a moment.
Ro - Ah... I'm just... Sorry!..
Ro - (I can't believe it... She never looked mature like that)
Rose quickly shuts the door.
Ar - Well, this is enough I believe.

Em - So how is it?
Ar - This seems passable to me. With some time and work you will surely be able to live with humans nicely.
Em - Really!? This makes me so happy. 
Em - Please, help me in the future too, Sir Arron!
Ar - Uh huh.
