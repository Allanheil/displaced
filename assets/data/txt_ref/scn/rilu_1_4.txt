KD - No way... You cursed freaks...
Having his forces defeated, the mortally wounded dwarven king fell to the floor. 
Ar - Phew... finally. 
Ar - Thanks Rilu, you were a great help. 
Ro - Indeed, we wouldn't make it without you. 
Ro - But how did you... Well...
=SPRITE rilu=
Ri - It's okay. 
Ri - I can't die. 
Em - You do bleed a lot though. 
Er - Ember, that was a bit too rude.
Em(sad) - Oh... Sorry...
Ri - Don't worry about it. I have a habit of such.
Ar(neutral) - What was that magic you used? I don't think I've seen it before.
Ri - I'm a necromancer. It's a power of the dead and spirits. 
Ro - (S-spirits? I knew it must be something creepy, but this is even worse...) 
Ar - Awesome! You can do something like that? 
Ar - I swear, the dead are so useless on their own. Can you also make skeletons and zombies?
Ri - W-well...
Er(happy) - Sir Arron is into some really weird things.
Ar - Hey Rose, why are you so pale all of a sudden? 
Ar - Wait, you are still afraid of ghosts and stuff? Come on, you are an adult now.
Ro - I-I'm not, I'm just tired from the fight. 
Ro - Anyway, let's leave this place already.
