The team has barged into the main city hall as Annet meets them there.
An - Look what we have here.
An - Can't say I expected to see you still alive.
Ar(neutral) - I knew you were a one kind of a bitch after learning your history with Erika.
Ar(neutral) - But must say, this is a whole different level. 
An - I'm glad you appreciate my work.
Ro(shock) - Your work? 
Ro(shock) - You are slaughtering innocent people!
An - People, cattle, who cares.
An - I'm glad we are finally past the acting stage and I don't have to deal with their stupidity.
An - Won't deny it, I did have my fun a couple of times though.
An - But it was taking too much time.
Ar(neutral) - Whatever, let's just beat the shit out of her.
An - Tsk, you are throwing away the few minutes of life I am gifting you.
An - And with such bad manners too.
An - I'll take care of your friends, once you die, Arron.
