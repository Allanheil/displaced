V - Looks like a perfect timing for me.
=SPRITE dragon=
Dr - Who are you, human?
Dr - You reek of death.
V - Must admit finding you hiding here was quite a task.
V - But I'm rather happy to finally be able to slay you.
Dr - You are awfully arrogant for a mere mortal, coming here alone.
V - *Sigh* Same thing every time.
Dr - ...?
*Slash*
At inhumane speed Victor cut the big dragon across the neck and wing. 
Dr - Y-you wretch...
=SPRITE victor=
V - Just die already.
Wounded and exhausted from the previous fight, the dragon had no chance against him. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
A nearly dead Qothus fell before Victor as life left his body.
V - Hmph, too easy. 
V - Well, can't blame you, after you've already been defeated today. 
V - Now, let's finally finish this. 
Victor raised his sword dealing a killing blow. 
*Slash*
V - Finally. This should be the last one...
V - ...
V - ...
Contrary to Victor's expectations, nothing unusual happened.
V - Fuck. So it's not over yet.

D - I think I ordered you to stop coming here as you please.
V - Whatever. 
D - In a bad mood, huh?
D - Having trouble with your silly quest?
V - Yeah.
V - I killed the last of the winged pests, but somehow it's not complete.
D - Maybe time to do some real jobs then?
V - Hey, you've given me the pass on this hunt.
D - Because dragons were dangerous to us.
D - You've driven them to extinction by this point.
V - I'm not doing it for fun, once I get all of their powers, we won't need to chase that fool.
D - Hmph, that's just your assumptions.
D - And you are out of luck now.
D - .....
D - Actually, I might have a lead for you.
V - You aren't trying to make me your dirty work, do you?
D - You make it sound like I'm some sort of scheming bastard. 
D - You must remember the wretch, Arron? The one who I told you to keep your eyes on?
V - You know I don't give a damn about weaklings.
D - And if you did, you'd know he has one notable follower.
V - ...

Ro - I've got a letter. Looks like it's about Ember.
Ar - Hmm? That's unusual. 
Ro - It says "I know you are hiding a dragon offspring. Give her away or your little village will be demolished."
Ro - "This is the only warning. Bring it to the Aeros' Forest entrance."
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, I guess we have a new task on our hands.
Ro - They make a threat against the village, and this looks like a trap.
Ro - Why would they need Ember? 
Ar(shock) - I don't care. My harem is mine and if they dare to threaten it, I won't give them any mercy.
Ro(sarcastic) - You really should stop seeing us as your property. 
Ar - You aren't property. 
Ar - I don't care about property. I care about cute girls.
Ro - Well, I guess we will know it once we get there.

Ar - This guy looks familiar.
Ro - This is Victor. We've seen him in Aeros.
I(shock) - Ah, it's the man who was talking to the father at that time.
V - You shouldn't have come, I only need the mongrel one. 
V - But now you all will die. 
V - Dimitrius will be happy I had to do his dirty work.
Em - Why? What do you want from me?
V - Nothing, you just seem to have something I need.
V - Damn you look weak.
Em - Eh? I don't understand. 
V - You don't? Haven't you been visiting the dragon lately?
Em - Uncle Qothus?..
V - That's its name? 
V - Sorry, I don't take note how my prey was called. 
Em - What?..
Em - You have...
V - Yes, I slayed it. 
Em(tired) - ...
Em(tired) - Why?
V - *Sigh* Why do men hunt? 
V - To dominate. To feed. To feel joy.
V - And also to test himself. 
Em - You killed Uncle Qothus!
Ro - Calm down, Ember!
V - Yeah, save yourself some energy for the fight.
Ar - So you test yourself by challenging some girl who looks weak and killing time-worn dragons?
V - Hmph. You have a sharp tongue boy.
V - But you are right, it's not much of a test.
Ar(neutral) - So what's your deal?
V - Do you know about dragon souls? 
Ar(neutral) - More or less.
V - I've been collecting them for long years. It seems one was hiding by your side.
Ar(neutral) - And I presume you'd get something by getting them all. 
V - Strength. Immortality. Power. You name it. 
V - A reward worthy of a supreme warrior.
V - And it all lies within my grasp now. 
V - The only reason I'm telling you about this is  your death looms. 
An(anger) - I'm sick of this psycho. He deserves some retribution.

Defeated Victor fell on his knees not in any condition to continue the fight.
V - Ghhh... How... Can I lose...
V - After all... these years...
V - Defeated... by a bunch of kids...
Ar(neutral) - This is over, you bastard. 
Ar(neutral) - Ember. 
Em - ...*nod*
Ember steadily advanced to crouching man.
V - You think... I'm scared of you?... 
*Crack*
=SOUND hit=
Em - ...
Ember's fist struck into Victor's face.
As Victor's skull cracked, the blade fell from his hand.
Ar - That was an uninspired last line.
Ro - Wha... What's going on?
A blade from Victor's hand began shining as it was covered in cracks. 
After a loud explosion streams of energy began dissipating in all directions.
Ar - These are...
Ri(talk) - Dragons souls are being freed. 
Ri(talk) - He can't suppress them any longer inside of his sword.
Em - Ah... 
Er - Wow, that's quite a sight.
Ro - Look, something happens to Ember!
Being close to the streams, a shining essence has been drawn from Ember's hands.
=BG scenes/ember_dragon=
The essence near ember began to form into a dragon shape.
Em - Is this...
Em - M-mother?
DrJr - Yes. 
DrJr - This seems to be at an end.
DrJr - I'm proud of you, Ember. 
DrJr - Sorry, I was a terrible parent. 
Em - No.
Em - You were with me all this time. 
Em - And you gave birth to me.
DrJr - You've grown well.
Em - Thank you.
Em - What happens now?
DrJr - You have freed their souls.
DrJr - Now they can be reborn into a new hatchling. 
Em - So, we saved them?
DrJr - Yes, you've done a great deed.
DrJr - But it seems I'll have to go too. 
Em - ...
Em - Thanks for staying with me all this time. 
DrJr - Heh, I was sure you'd be crying here.
Em - Maybe we can meet again?
DrJr - After rebirth we will not remember who we were in previous life.
DrJr - But I'm glad you have found your place and friends you can rely on. 
DrJr - Arron. You are still to face great dangers, but I trust you to take care of my daughter. 
Ar - Hmm... I'm not sure I'm up to the responsibility yet. 
DrJr - Don't worry, I'm  sure you can make Ember some fine offspring with some practice.
Em - Eh?!
DrJr - After all I've almost had first-hand experience.
Ar - You had what?!
DrJr - Don't act so surprised now. My daughter is too innocent to take initiative, so I gave her a couple of hints.
Ar - ...And took some liberty in the bedroom...?
DrJr - That was the best for all of us. 
DrJr - But it's time for me to go. 
DrJr - Good luck, children. 
With last words vanishing in the air so did the image of Ezet.
=BG villageday=
Ar - ...Look, it wasn't as lewd as you imagine. 
Ro - Disgusting.
Em - Ah, so that's why I acted like that.
Ri - ...
Er - Kinky.
I(sad) - Hmm I'm not sure how ancestors would feel about it.
Ar - Okay, enough. 
Ar - Let's get out of here, before someone sees us and blames us for murdering Aeros's hero.
