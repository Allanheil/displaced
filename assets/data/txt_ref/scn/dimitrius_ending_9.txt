After a few clashes Dimitrius has managed to strike Arron's sword from his hands.
Ar(shock) - Ah!
De - And it's over.
Ar(anger) - Like hell it is!
Taken by surprise, Dimitrius was attacked by barehanded Arron, throwing him on the ground.
=SOUND tumble=
What he didn't see is how Arron pulled the shock baton out of his clothes.
De(anger) - What the-
=SOUND shocker=
Bzzzzt
De(anger) - Arrggh... You bastard...
As the baton was connected to Dimitrius body, electrical shock ran through his body completely immobilizing and depowering him to the point he couldn't speak easily.
Ar - Hah, so it does work on you after all. 
De(anger) - You... Will pay for this...
Arron kept Dimitrius in one spot as electrical current continued to restrict him.
Ar(neutral) - You know what really gets on my nerves? 
De(anger) - You are... just postponing the inevitable...
Ar(neutral) - It's your trash attitude towards us. 
De(anger) - You still... can't kill me...
Ar(neutral) - Humans aren't the animals you take us for.
De(anger) - And once energy... runs out...
Ar(neutral) - I actually believe we can achieve great things.
De(anger) - You will... fucking die...
Ar(neutral) - You aren't even listening. 
Ar - Well, at least you won't tell it to others.

Meanwhile Rose has finally grasped the controls of the reactor. 
Ro(talk) - Alright, I'm starting it.
Er - Roger, I'll let Rilu know.
Ro - Master, please be safe.

Ri - ...It's starting.
Ri(talk) - Iola, wait for my signal.
I - O-okay!
Rilu began to chant the spell, as lights around the structure began to work.

As Arron kept Dimitrius disabled, he sensed how the mechanisms around him went into motion and small lights turned on.
Ar(neutral) - It seems I don't have much time left. 
De - ...Hah... starting to regret... your arrogance?
Ar(neutral) - I've heard that demons hate light. 
De(anger) - (Keep talking fool, I only need a bit more to break free)
Ar - You might have no idea, but this weird place is called a fusion reactor. 
De(anger) - Watcha... talking about...
Ar - Amazingly, it is able to eminate the power of the Sun itself.
Ar - Given your condition, it seems my shocker has nearly run out of power. 
Ar - So, say, do you think you will be able to survive fifty millions degree heat?
De - Enough!
Dimitrius pushed Arron away with a slowly returning power, still oblivious to what was going on around him. 
=SOUND fall=
Ar(shock) - Behind!
Realizing that Arron indeed saw something behind him, Dimitrius looked around to find a huge cloud of forming plasma spreading through the reactor's coil.
In the same moment Arron disappeared from his previous place.
De(anger) - ...Teleportation?
De - You fool, did you forget who I am?
De - ...
De(anger) - Huh?
De(anger) - Something stops me? 
De(anger) - HOW!?
De(anger) - ARR-

As the reactor fully powered, plasma erased his body without a trace.

Ar - Thanks Iola, that was rather close.
I - N-no problem, we were lucky.
Ri(talk) - Yes, thankfully it worked.

Ar(neutral) - Oh-uh.
Em - What's happening?
Ri(talk) - Rose says the reactor had a leakage, we should run before the building collapses.
Ar(neutral) - Will they be alright?
Ri - Yes, let's go.

Ro(talk) - We made it!
Ro - Look, demons are gone. 
Ri - Yes, with Dimitrius dead the dimensions are no longer connected. 
Ar - Nice work. Time to go home then. 
Em - Huh... Is this place going to stay in our world though?
Ar - Not my problem.

Ar - Hey, we are back and alive.
F - Nice to see you then, ex-mayor.
Ar(neutral) - ...What do you mean, 'ex-mayor'?
F - Oh, we have elected a new mayor since you were gone and we had no idea if you are even alive.
Ar(shock) - WHAAAT?!
F - There he is by the way.
=SPRITE caliban=
Ar - ...Eh? How?
F - Well, he said that he will stop the end of the world if we get him elected. 
Cy - Oh, Hi Arron. How are you doing?
Ar - ...I'll fucking murder you. 
Ar(shock) - It was me who stopped the end of the world, not him!
G - Yeah, sure, you weren't even around most of the time.
Ar(shock) - I-
Ro(talk) - Master, isn't it fine? We have to return home soon anyway.
Ar(neutral) - ......
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Ar(neutral) - Whatever. But how do you plan to do it? Dimitrius is gone now.
I - Umh, I think I've some of those powers, when he died I felt like they went into me. 
I(sad) - Maybe because we were related.
I - I think I'll be able to transfer you back to your world.
F - Well now, don't be so rushy, we surely can celebrate your return before you go.
Ar - ...Thanks.
