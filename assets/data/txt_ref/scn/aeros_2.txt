Ar - Hey, we dealt with that dwarf issue.  & EV_AEROS_2_0
Guard - Which dwarf issue?  & EV_AEROS_2_1
Ar(neutral) - The one you told us to take care of. Bloodthirsty dwarves and such, remember? & EV_AEROS_2_2
Guard - No idea what you are talking about. & EV_AEROS_2_3
Ar - Carl, please, you are really getting on my nerves. & EV_AEROS_2_4
Guard_2 - I'm not Carl. That guy was kicked out a few days ago. & EV_AEROS_2_5
Ar(neutral) - Argh... Whatever. We've dealt with dwarves, now let us pass. We had an agreement. & EV_AEROS_2_6
Guard_2 - Look, I don't know anything about the agreement. And Iâ€™m only seeing you for the first time. & EV_AEROS_2_7
Guard_2 - You are free to pass through. No idea what that moron Carl said to you, but the entrance is free.  & EV_AEROS_2_8
Ar - ...... & EV_AEROS_2_9
Ro - It's all good, we can enter the city now, right? & EV_AEROS_2_10
Ar(neutral) - That bastard was really lucky his face was hidden by a helmet.  & EV_AEROS_2_11
