In a large hall an unknown man laid defeated as Rilu was inspecting something in her hand.
Ar(neutral) - Rilu? What's been going on here?
Ri - Arron.
Ri - You've been following me?
?(Z) - You should stop her... If you want to live.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm? Who's this guy?
Ri - It's Zelroth. He used to be my student in the past.
Ar(neutral) - I think I've heard this name in town. 
Ri - He used to be a gifted scientist and a doctor, but now he seems to prefer to raise the dead instead.
Ar - ...And that thing in your hand?
Ri - ........
Rilu demonstrates a small black ring. 
Ri - It's an ancient artifact - The Circle.
=SPRITE zelroth=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.1=
Z - She plans to destroy the world with it.
Ar - What?
Ri(spell) - Stay down.
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Invisible force has pushed Zelroth back onto the floor.
Z - Gh!..
Despite that he continued to talk.
Z - Long time ago an ancient race had this ring.
Z - It's the ultimate doomsday device.
Z - And it's capable of destroying our whole reality.
Ar(neutral) - That's a bit hard to imagine.
Z - Why don't you ask your "friend" then.

Ar(neutral) - ...Rilu?
Ri(talk) - I believe it to be true.
Ri - The world is in perpetual motion. 
Ri - People are born, live and die, their children are born to repeat the cycle. 
Ri - The sun rises only to set and then repeats this cycle indefinitely
Ri(talk) - That's the nature of existence, the one we are in, at least.
Ri(talk) - The Circle supposedly can stop it once and for all.
Ar(neutral) - You came here for this?
Ri - Yes. This was my goal all along. 
Ri - I was planning for it long before we met.
Ri - I have deceived you so I could find the ring.
Ar(neutral) - But why?
Ri - I can explain, but I don't expect you to understand it.
Ar(neutral) - No hurt in trying.
Ri - ...
Ri - I hate this world. 
Ri - And I hate this life.  
Ri(talk) - I have been evil all along.
Ri(talk) - And I want it to be destroyed. 
Ar(neutral) - But why would you kill yourself? 
Ri(talk) - *Sigh*
Ri - Because life to me is endless suffering.
Ri - I've told you before, my existence is nothing but agony.
Ri(talk) - I'm dead tired of being injured, tortured, left at the mercy of a mob or a toy for some maniac.
Ar(neutral) - I don't get it. Aren't you fine now? Don't you have fri-
Ri - I said, you won't understand it.
Ri - This is only a glimpse of peace in my eternity.
Ri - These never last long for me.
Ri(talk) - You can live and die, but I'll keep existing.
Ri - I'll be feared and hunted again in no time.
Ri - This is the cycle of my life, and I hate it. 
Ri - I hate people and nothing is better than ending it once for all.
Ar(neutral) - ...Is that really so? 
Ri(talk) - You won't stop me. 
Ar(neutral) - I don't believe you. 
Ri(talk) - Stop being stup-
Ar(neutral) - You are right. I can't understand how terrible your suffering was. 
Ar(neutral) - But I do understand that it's bad enough to make you wish to end the world.
Ar(neutral) - It must be why you show so few emotions too.
Ar(neutral) - Must really put off the bastards who tortured you for fun.
Ri - .......
Ar(neutral) - But you are also lying through your teeth.
Ar(neutral) - You aren't evil, and you absolutely don't hate people. You hardly used us either.
Ri - You are not making any sense.
Ar(neutral) - Despite all hardships you don't blame others.
Ar(neutral) - And you don't show any real grudge towards them.
Ar(neutral) - You care for me and you cared enough to save Iola, even though you hardly knew her.
Ar(neutral) - You pretend to be evil, because this way you hope to make me reject you.
Ar(neutral) - So you would have an easier time doing what you've planned
Ar - But I won't hate you. 
Ar - And I'm sure the other villagers and girls like you as well.
Ri(talk) - ...Shut up.
Ar(neutral) - What happened to you is unfortunate... No, terrible. 
Ar - But I can swear to you that nobody will abuse you as long as I live.
Ar - This might be not much for you, but this much I can guarantee. 
Ar - Don't you think that killing us all can wait for some time? 
Ar - I can't stop you after I'm dead anyway.
Ri - ...Y-You won't fool me.	
Ar(neutral) - You know I'm being serious. 
Ri - (What's this... Why am I trembling?)
Ar(neutral) - So, what do you say? 
Ar - The others might get worried if they find out we are missing. 
Ar - And it looks like something got in your eyes.
Ri - ......
Rilu wiped her face with a sleeve.
Ri(talk) - ...Fine, I'll trust you. 
Ri - Let's go th-
Before Rilu could finish her sentence a large monster broke into the hall.
=SHAKE_SCREEN 0.5=
=SPRITE caliban=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.1=
C - Master!
C - I'm here. 
Z - Caliban, get her!
C - Raaargh!
Before they managed to react, the monster charged into Rilu.
Ar(shock) - Oh shit!
Arron tackled Rilu out of the way and they both tumbled onto the floor as the monster missed them.
=SOUND cling=
More undead started pouring from all directions.
=SPRITE skeleton=
Ar(shock) - We are in trouble!
Ri(spell) - .....
Rilu casted a spell and the room went pitch dark. 
=SPRITE_FADE 0.2=
Without wasting any time they snuck from the castle.

Ar - Whew... That was a handy trick. Are you alright?
Ri - Yes. 
Ri - I didn't think I'd be returning though.
Ar - At least you are not doing it alone. 
Ar(neutral) - What happened to The Circle?
Ri - I dropped it when you pushed me.
Ar(neutral) - Oh... Sorry.
Ri - It's fine. 
Ri(talk) - I'm not gonna need it any time soon.
Ar - Good to hear that.
.....
Ri(talk) - Thank you for coming, Arron.
Ri - You've done for me more, than anyone before. 
Ar - Come on, youâ€™re gonna make me blush.
