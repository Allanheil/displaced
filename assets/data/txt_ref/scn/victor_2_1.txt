V - Looks like a perfect timing for me.
=SPRITE dragon=
Dr - Who are you, human?
Dr - You reek of death.
V - Must admit finding you hiding here was quite a task.
V - But I'm rather happy to finally be able to slay you.
Dr - You are awfully arrogant for a mere mortal, coming here alone.
V - *Sigh* Same thing every time.
Dr - ...?
*Slash*
At inhumane speed Victor cut the big dragon across the neck and wing. 
Dr - Y-you wretch...
=SPRITE victor=
V - Just die already.
Wounded and exhausted from the previous fight, the dragon had no chance against him.

A nearly dead Qothus fell before Victor as life left his body.
V - Hmph, too easy. 
V - Well, can't blame you, after you've already been defeated today. 
V - Now, let's finally finish this. 
Victor raised his sword dealing a killing blow. 
*Slash*
V - Finally. This should be the last one...
V - ...
V - ...
Contrary to Victor's expectations, nothing unusual happened.
V - Fuck. So it's not over yet.

D - I think I ordered you to stop coming here as you please.
V - Whatever. 
D - In a bad mood, huh?
D - Having trouble with your silly quest?
V - Yeah.
V - I killed the last of the winged pests, but somehow it's not complete.
D - Maybe time to do some real jobs then?
V - Hey, you've given me the pass on this hunt.
D - Because dragons were dangerous to us.
D - You've driven them to extinction by this point.
V - I'm not doing it for fun, once I get all of their powers, we won't need to chase that fool.
D - Hmph, that's just your assumptions.
D - And you are out of luck now.
D - .....
D - Actually, I might have a lead for you.
V - You aren't trying to make me your dirty work, do you?
D - You make it sound like I'm some sort of scheming bastard. 
D - You must remember the wretch, Arron? The one who I told you to keep your eyes on?
V - You know I don't give a damn about weaklings.
D - And if you did, you'd know he has one notable follower.
V - ...
