I - Arron, I've got good news.
Ar - You've found a way to make Rose's boobs bigger?
I - N-no... Rilu taught me how to use that pearl you got to summon its owner. 
Ar - Oh... I'm already focused on the idea of giving Rose a huge rack.
Ar - Maybe at least temporarily.
Ro(sarcastic) - I'm also here you know.
Ar - Jeez, fine. 
Ar - What about that mysterious guy?
I(sad) - Well, I hope he can help me to understand what's going on with Father.
Ro - And he might know how we can get back. 
Ar - How awfully convenient. 
I - There's a ritual which will allow us to summon him, but we would need a special place of power. 
I - Rilu said she's seen one where you found her. 
Ro - Ugh, those caves...
Ar - I see. Well, might as well try it since there's not much else to do.
