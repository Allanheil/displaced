Day town bg, goblin sprite
G - Bet I'll throw this rock further than you.
Ar - Like hell you will.
*swoosh*
Ar - Hmph, try to beat this.
G - Hah. 
*swoosh*
Ar(shock) - What the heck?! You’re cheating!
Ar(neutral) - No way you can throw it that far with your height. 
G - Gold please.
Ar(neutral) - Hmph.
Io - Sir Arron?
Ar - Aye.
Ar - *whisper* Hey you, get lost.
G - Sure, loser.
*iola sprite*
Io - What are you doing here?
Ar - Nothing much, Rose and Ember are away until tomorrow to gather some ingredients.
Io(sad) - So that's why you are all alone.
Ar(neutral) - Hey, don't make it sound like I'm some creep.
Io - Oh, that wasn't what I meant.
Ar - You look worried, did something happen?
Io(sad) - N-no, nothing like that, it's just...
Io - I haven’t trained anymore - since the last time.
Ar - ...
Ar(shock) - Why didn't you say so sooner?!
Io - I was a bit embarrassed I guess.
Ar - Say no more, let's go!
Io - No, wait, I have to prepare myself.
Io - I'll be waiting in your room this evening.
Ar - Sheesh, fine. 
*remove sprite*
Ar(neutral) - Huh... What do I do now?
Ar - Hey, Gobbo, wanna make a new bet?
*blackscreen transition
*townhall cg
Ar - (Hmm, there's light in my room, I guess Iola is already there)
Ar - I'm coming in.
*door open sound*
*blackscreen*
switch to cg1
Io - Please come in.
Ar - Hoh, what a sight.
Io - This is... Sort of embarrassing.
Ar - I'd imagine that is the point of this training.
Io - You are right.
Ar - Well, are you ready?
Io - ...Yes, go on please.
*switch to cg2
Io - Ah!..
Ar - Hey, don't raise your voice so much.
Ar - I've barely touched you.
Io - S-Sorry, it's the first time for me...
Io - I'm not sure how to react.
Ar - You are pretty wet.
Ar - Looks like you are properly aroused.
Io - Is that so...?
*switch to cg3*
Io - Aah! 
Io - W-What are you doing?
Ar - this is what we are here for, isn’t it? 
Ar - Helping you to feel good and confident.
Io - Mnh... This...
Io - Your tongue...
Io - Ah... I've never felt... like this...
Ar - You are managing nicely.
Io - You... Ah... think so?
Ar - Yep, Rose is still very embarrassed by this kind of thing, despite our past.
Io - I... can't blame her...
*switch to cg4*
Ar - Hehe, looks like you are getting impatient.
Io - Ah... Please...
Io - Don't stop...
Ar - For your first time getting cunnilingus you got into it pretty quickly.
Io - That must be... because of my mission...
Ar - What a pious follower you are.
Io - Ah... I can't...
*switch to cg5*
Ar - Hey, slow down a bit. 
Io - Aaah... 
Io - What... Am I...
Ar - Wow, you are like an animal in heat.
Io - I... can't stop...
Ar - Fine, fine, let's finish this.
Io - Aahh... Are you..?
Io - AAAaahhh!!...
*switch to cg6*
*white*
Ar - Wow, that was a bit messy.
Io - Ah... hah... I'm sorry...
Ar - It’s fine.
Io - I didn't realize that it would beso much better than doing it by myself.
Ar - That's only natural.
Io - I see...
*switch to normal bg*
*black screen transition*
Io - I want to thank you, Sir Arron.
Ar - Don't mention  it. 
Io - I hope you'll keep helping me with my training.
Ar(shock) - You think I'd pass up such an opportunity?
Io - Ha-ha, I guess no.
