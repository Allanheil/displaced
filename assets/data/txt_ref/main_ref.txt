The Kingdom of Avior has been at peace for the last few centuries. Political stability felt almost taken for granted not only by the citizens, but even by royalty. 
Military successes of the previous king, Mizar, provided his family with a big and strong country, which rightfully ruled to this day.
His son and successor, Alcor, reinforced his father's achievements and continued his rulership.
As it happens in a monarchy, his first son, Norbert, prepared to take his place, given his father’s old age.
However, in his twenties, the second prince Arron is nothing but trouble to his family...

Nt(anger) - Check all the cabinets, and look under the bed!
Guard - There's nothing under the bed, m'lord. 
Guard2 - Cabinets are empty as well.
Guard3 - Balcony is not opening.

Arron, with his hands tied behind his back sits on the floor of a large cell. Norbert observes him, while his subordinates prepare for a ritual.
Rose hides among the shadows of a far corner, unnoticed.
Nt - You know, it was funny when you convinced the Pope that Aunt Mary had been possessed by the devil so he performed a whole ceremony for her. 
Ar - Everyone knows old people are evil. That's why they are still with us and not with God.
Nt - ...it also was rather amusing when you brought a bunch of homeless people to our dining hall during the negotiations with Reines and insisted that you will become their king in a new nation.
Ar - Bob could also replace me as a King. 
Nt - You are not taking this seriously, are you? Tell me, were you really not satisfied with all those palace maids and feudal daughters? Why go after my wife? 
Ar - Dunno, you went for her for some reason. You don't know either?
Nt(anger) - THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON!? Because she's MY wife?
Ar - Nah, she also seemed quite delighted with my company. I mean, how can you ignore someone who eagerly woos you?
Nt(anger) - Shut the hell up, I'm not going to hear from you that my wife is unfaithful. 
Ar(neutral) - Sure, it's all my fault.
Nt - Your wildness had been ignored by father way too many times.
Ar - Hah. So what you gonna do? You can't kill or imprison me. Everyone will realize you did it, and the people won't like it. 
Nt - True. Even though many nobles find your behavior displeasing, killing you isn’t really worth it. You have to disappear.
Ar(neutral) - ... What? This is what you are preparing?
=BG scenes/dungeon_2 0.5=
As they kept talking, a number of magical runes across the floor began to glow. 
Nt - Yes and we are about to finish. This portal spell will send you where you won't be causing us any more troubles ever again. 
Arron's eyes widened with surprise and disbelief.
Ar(neutral) - (Uh, shit, he seems to actually be serious this time.)
Ar(shock) - Hey, stop it, Norb, father will know! 
Nt - Nobody will know, and the nobles will confirm that you just disappeared during the night. Everyone will be happier without you around.

Ar(shock) - Rose? What the...

Just as she enters the circle, the spell completes, the light fading, and revealing the empty space where once was two people.

The pairtakes a long look at their surroundings, finding only desert and rocks. 
Ar(neutral) - Shit, I really shouldn't have slept during those geography lessons.
Ar(neutral) - Norb will really pay for this once I get back.
Ar - First I'll have to take care of those suspicious guys with him...
Ro - I think it will be better if we start moving.
Ar - Yeah, it doesn’t seem like anyone will be coming to help us any time soon. Let's go.
Ro - Where to?

After days worth of walking, and losing hope, Arron and Rose come across a small, poor settlement.

Ar(neutral) - Looks more like a dunghole to me.
Ro - We haven't seen any people for 2 days... Let's check it out at least.

Arron calls for the attention of a single goblin who does not seem surprised by his appearance.

Ar(neutral) - Hey you, what is this place? 
G - What does it look like to you? We live here.

G - Do I look like I ever went anywhere else? And what’s a map? 
Ro - ...
Ar(neutral) - Yet, you don't look very surprised by us. 
G - Freaking big deal. Adventurers come and go all the time. Some even stay and leech off our food.
Ar - Curious, and whose domain is this? 
G - Eh? We don't belong to anyone since nobody really cares about this land. 
G - This place might look like a dump, but it's totally independent. 
Ar(shock) - What? Who governs you then? You don't even have a leader?
G - No. I told just you that...
Hearing that Arron's eyes quickly shine with fervor.
Ar - You heard it? These savages need a governor!
Ro(sarcastic) - With all respect, I don't think you will be able to lead...
Ar - Tell me, friend, do you know the benefits of having someone to organize and take care of town's problems?

After becoming the settlement's mayor, Arron and Rose moved into the best available house.
Ar - See that? And they were saying democracy is a mistake.
Ro(sarcastic) - (Makes me realize why)
Ro(talk) - I must say, this is a rather nice living space.
Ro(talk) - Oh, and we also have our first visitor today.
Ar - People want to meet their new leader. Let's not keep them waiting. Bring them in.
A shabby looking goblin casually walks in, disinterestedly looking around.
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
=DELAY 0.5=
G - Oi, Governor, since you are responsible for the village now, Flak from market asks you to visit him.
Ar(neutral) - (No manners at all, huh)
Ar(neutral) - Why did he not visit himself?
G - He is busy, I guess. Just don't take too long.

The goblin disappears, leaving Arron mildly baffled. 
Ar(neutral) - You bring him here then.

Ro - I've finished asking around.
Ro - It seems there's no known info about Avior, or where it even might be. 
Ar - You made sure not to give away where we came from, right? 
Ro - Yes. Thankfully, there's plenty of adventurers passing by around here, often anonymously. 
Ro - Anyway, these lands are called Vienar. 
Ar(neutral) - Never heard of such a name. 
Ro - Me neither. 
Ro - Most of civilization seems to be run by independent city-states, who seem to trade and share frequently, but most oppose each other on some political level. 
Ro - But, our village lies somewhat distant from most other cities, hence why there's little interest in this place.
Ar - So... that means we can stay here safely?
Ro - That also means we have no idea how to get back.
Ro(sarcastic) - Wait, master, are you actually planning to return? 
Ar - Hm... Maybe.
Ro(talk) - What!? We can't stay here for the rest of our lives. 
Ar - Why not?
Ro(sarcastic) - Aren’t you going to miss your family? Your royal life?
Ar - Well, I have to get revenge on Norb, don't I.
Ar - Relax, I'm just kidding. I guess our only option to get back is how we got here. We’re gonna need some skilled mages. 
Ro - That already might prove to be a challenge. From what passing adventurers said, teleportation magic doesn’t seem to be common around here.
Ar - Well, all the more reason to make sure our position here is nice and stable.
Ar - Plus when else am I going to get the chance to rule anyone but mere servants?

Ar - I'm good. Just curious how you are doing.
Em - Oh, it's great here! And you visit me regularly too. 
Em - In the past people didn't seem to like having me around the village, but you seem so relaxed about it.
Ar - I'm a dragon's descendant just like you.
Em(happy) - What?! REALLY?
Ar - Maybe. 
Em - Oh... that might be true because you are not afraid of me.
Em - My appearance must be what repulses other people... Do you think I'll be able to find some place where I would be accepted?
Ar - Hmmm. True, people want to see something similar to them, rather than different. 
Em(tired) - Oh... this makes me sad. 
Ar - But you know what? You might still eventually pass for a human. 
Em - Oooh? I can? 
Ar - Naturally, you have some human characteristics, after all, I'm just not entirely sure how authentic they are.
Em(tired) - Uh... Sorry, I don't understand.
Ar - I'm saying that I'll need to investigate your body to see if you can pass for a human.
Em - OOOOH, Sir Arron, you can do this for me!? 
Ar - Well if you request it, it's my job to make sure everyone here is happy. 
Em - Okay, please! Let me just untie my apron.

Em - And you already said I'm pretty.
Ar - This doesn't sound like you came up with this yourself.
Ar - Who told you that?

Ar - (Nah, It's definitely a trap.)
Ar - Sure, the bedroom is over there.
Em - Ahaha... Okay, sorry that I’m not really sure what to do.

Ar - This is just the start. Looks like it really is your first time.
Em - Is that bad?
Ar - Nah, I actually feel a bit honored.
Saying that Arron pushed his lips into Ember's while massaging her chest and pussy.

Ar - You didn't like that?
Em - I did! Sex feels really good.
Ar - This isn't sex yet, though.
Em - Eh? It's not? 
Ar - Yep, this is just a foreplay. 
Arron quickly freed himself from clothes, revealing his manhood to the curious dragon girl.
Em - Woah, it's so big... That's called a penis, right?
Ar - Hmh um, it is great, indeed.
Ar - Now relax, this might be painful for your first time.

Ar - Huh... It didn't hurt?
Em - No, it only stung a bit, but it feels really good.
Ar - Darn, it must be good to be a dragon's descendant. Oh well.
Em - What are you...
Meeting no resistance from Ember, Arron begins to slowly grind her wet pussy.
Em - Mmh... I feel... Tingly inside...
Ar - Yep, this is what sex is. 
Ar - Do you like it, Ember?
Em - Ahhh... I don't... know...
Em - Don't stop, Arron.
Arron felt like something in Ember's tone changed, having a mature hint not being present previously.
Em - Yes... This feels great...
Em - I can feel you inside my body.
Ar - Ember...?
Em - Please, keep moving...
=ABG ember_miss_4=
Ember acted unlike her usual self, but at this point, Arron has lost any will to question anything.
Em - Ah... I'm feeling it coming...

Without giving him any time to react, Ember strongly embraced him to her chest.
Em - Yess... Just a bit...

Ar - Don't worry, it felt great.

Er - Hey, Arron.
Ar - What's up?
Er(happy) - Let's have sex!
Ar - ...I thought it was usually guys who take initiative here.
Er - But you haven't made any attempts all this time and I got really lonely.
Er(happy) - And look, you’re already hard!
With little concern, Erika moved her hand under Arron's clothes.
Er - After all, I came here because I've taken a liking of you.
Er - Why haven't you approached me for so long?
Ar - I imagined you would wish to leave right after this...
Ar - Ow, slow down a bit!
Er(happy) - Silly. I'm not like that. 
Er - Don't you know elves stay with one partner for life?
Ar - ...Really? 
Er(happy) - Nah, that's just a superstition.
Er - But if I stayed around for so long, I'd be willing to continue doing so.
Er - If you accept my feelings, that is.
Ar - Looks like there's no other option here... 
Ar - (Damn, I'm not used to a girl being so aggressive)
Er - Look, my pussy is drenched.
Smiling, Erika took Arron's hand and led it down her waist as her other hand kept stroking his dick.
Ar - (Since when have I taken the role of sub? Screw it!)
With determination Arron grabbed Erika's head bringing her lips close to him.
Er - MMH! Mmmm...
Meanwhile, his hand moved into Erika's panties.

Er - Perhaps you wish for a look at the finer details? Here you go...
=ABG erika_sex_2 erika_sex_3=
Erika invitingly spread her pussy lips, presenting Arron her narrow slit.
Ar - I think this is the first time I've seen someone this lewd.
Er - Fufu... You don't have to flatter me anymore, you know.
Ar - Have it your way. 
With no delay, Arron penetrated Erika from behind.
=ABG erika_sex_4 erika_sex_5=
Er - AH! That's the spot...
Ar - Ooh, despite the wetness you are pretty tight.
Er - Mmmh, you seem to appreciate the greatness of a perfect elven pussy.

Arron gradually increased his speed, until Erika's words consisted more of moans than anything else.
=ABG erika_sex_6 erika_sex_7=
Er - Yes, Arron, your dick feels amaaaazing...
Er - Fuck me harder, fuck this elven cunt!...

Er - Ah... You are fucking this naughty elf like a dog in heat...
Er - And this turns me on... so much...
Ar - (Jeez, I hope at least there's nobody outside to hear her screams)
Er - Are you going to cum? Fill me up.

Ar - Must say, you have quite a temper. It was unlike anything I've seen before.
Er - You don't like it?
Ar - No, it was just a bit unexpected but certainly very arousing. Maybe I should make Rose act like this sometimes as well.
Er - Fufu, Rose is a cutie. That might not suit her as well. 
Er - It would be nice to have fun with her someday.
Ar - I don't think she swings that way. 
Er(happy) - Well if you give me permission, we can make her try out something new.

Er - What I need is a rare herb we elves often use for relaxation. 
Er - So can you help me get some of that? 
Ar - I suppose. But is it safe for non-elves? 
Er(happy) - Of course it is. It's just rather hard to come by since elves cultivate it secretly.

Arron observed, bewildered, as Erika smoothly pulled Rose into her arms.
Unlike what normally happens, Rose shows no sign of resistance, even while aware her master is only a few feet away.
Ar - (This elven tea is pretty dangerous. Unlike alcohol, Rose does not appear to be intoxicated at all)
Er - Rose, I must say you are so beautiful.
Er - Arron is one happy man to have someone like you always around.
Ro - Oh, don’t flatter me, Erika... You have such a gorgeous figure...
Er - No way. Your ears and tail are charming. I'm really jealous of Arron.
Ro - Stop, you're making me blu...
=ABG erika_rose_sofa_2 erika_rose_sofa_3=
Cutting Rose's hints of embarrassment short, Erika firmly pressed her lips against Rose.
Ro - Mhh!
Ro - Mmmm...
Just when Arron would expect Rose to back off, she unexpectedly closed her eyes and took Erika's kiss with apparent joy.
=ABG erika_rose_sofa_4 erika_rose_sofa_5=
Ro - Erika, you are a really good kisser.
Er - Fufu, I'm glad you approve.
Touching lips again, Erika's hand slowly went over Rose's tunic, revealing her modest chest.
=ABG erika_rose_sofa_6 erika_rose_sofa_7=
Ro - Mmhm...
Despite the exposure, Rose shows no worry. 
Which surprised Arron, as he expected her to show some resistance. 
After playing a bit with her nipples, Erika's hand moved to Rose's panties.
=ABG erika_rose_sofa_8 erika_rose_sofa_9=
Ro - Erika... I would never imagine doing something like this with another girl.
Er - Don't worry, I promise you won't be disappointed. 
Rose bit her lip, as Erika skillfully played with her body. 
Ro - Ahh... You make me so horny...
Ar - Not just you. 
Er - (Fufu, enjoying the show?)
Er - Rose, you are so sensitive. I feel excited just playing with you.
Ar - (But what's actually going on? She’s  unlike like her usual self.)
Er - (The herb blocked her sense of shame. It's commonly used by young elves to overcome their shyness.)
Ro - Master, Erika, what are you whispering about? 
Er - Nothing important, dear.
Er - Now, let me show you something great.

Erika laid down, inviting a naked Rose on top of her.
Without any warning, Erika grabbed Rose's ass and stuck her tongue deep in her pussy.
Rose let out a surprised yelp, but quickly her face changed to that of bliss.
Er - What a sweet pussy you have. 
Erika continued working her way over Rose's crotch, as she bathed in pleasure.
Ro - Mmmh...
Er - Don't forget about your side of the bed, Rose.
Blinking in confusion, Rose realized she has to repay Erika for her pleasure and timidly slurped on the elven girl's pussy.
=ABG erika_rose_69_2 erika_rose_69_3=
Er - Yes... Keep going.
Er - Your mouth feels great, Rose. 
For the next few minutes, Arron observed two naked girls moan as they eat each other out to orgasm.
Ro - Ahhh... Erika!!
Er - Mmhmm!
=ABG erika_rose_69_4 erika_rose_69_5=
Despite it, they didn't seem to be satisfied with it and continued their activity. 
=ABG erika_rose_69_6 erika_rose_69_7=
Er - Hehe, it seems like Rose is not easily satisfiable.
Er - Say, Arron, have you tried Rose's ass? 
Hearing those words, Arron spots how Erika gently sticks her wet finger up Rose's ass, while holding her by the base of the tail.
Ar - Nah, she acted really unhappy whenever I tried.
Er - That's a shame, Rose. You have such a pretty butt, but you won't let your master use it.
Rose seemingly drunk from recent orgasm took some time to gather her thoughts on the subject.
Ro - It's... Indecent...
Er - It's not, you should let Arron do it to you. 
Ro - ...Fine...
Er - Is that how you address your master? 
Er - Say, 'Master, please fuck my rosy virgin butthole'.
Ro - ...
Er - Say it or I'll stop. 
Ro - Master... Please fuck my virgin rosy butthole.
Er - See? Wasn't hard at all.
Erika wrapped her lips around Rose's clit as a reward. 
Ro - Ah! Master...
Arron finally released from his clothes, positioned himself against Rose's ass with Erika's face below it.
=ABG erika_rose_69_8 erika_rose_69_9=
Rose's butt quickly surrendered to him, wet from Erika's saliva and her own juices.

=ABG erika_rose_69_10 erika_rose_69_11=
Er - Yeah, fuck this bitch's asshole!
Er - You are such a dirty slut, Rose, just look at how much your cunt is dripping.

Er - Fiiine. But let's try something different next time.

Rose was prepared to say something, but it stuck in her throat.

Everyone in the room aside from Rilu went into a silent state.
Ar - I bet you all wish you’d stay this young for so long.
Ro(sarcastic) - I dunno about that.
Er - Nah, I'm good.
Ri - I heavily advise against it.
Ri - So, I can really stay with you?
Ar - No, you must stay with us. 
Ar - I'm not going to let a live friendly necromancer not join us.
Ro - If Master has set his mind on something, he'll always stick to it.
Er(happy) - This harem seems to get weirder and weirder. 
Ar - Plus, there's a thing you might be able to help us out with.
Ri - Ah?

As they finished explaining their problem, Rilu has harshly broken their hope.
Ri - I've never heard about such means of transportation.
Ri - However, there might be one person I know who might know something.
Ar - Huh? Wouldn't all people you know be feeding the worms?
Ri - Normally. That isn't as big of a deal as I could summon their spirits, but I'm not actually sure if he's dead. 
Ri - A few centuries ago there was a small religious group worshipping the deity. 
Ri - According to them, he was the creator of this world, which was born from his dandruff.
Ro - Ew.
Ri - Yes. They did seem like just a bunch of lunatics, but I've actually met them before I met the group.
Ar - Did you get any of his dandruff by chance? 
Ar - I mean you could sell it to those guys...
Ri(blush) - No, but I've realized he's been living for much longer than me.
Ri - So I began to pursue him, to see if he knows something about my problem.
Ri - But he wasn't weak like me. And he knew nothing about it either. He didn't reveal his secrets either. 
Ri - I've seen him teleport like you are speaking about as if it were as simple as walking.
Ri - He also insisted that he wouldn't interfere with this world's business.
Ar - So you think he's not of this world as well?
Ri - Back then I thought it was the case. 
Ar - That's actually something. Let's try to see what we can find then. And thanks, Rilu.
Ri - ...Don't mention it.

Ar - Hey there. Whatcha doing?
Ar - What's with this weird statue.
Ri - It's a request from one of the villagers. Seems like this thing is cursed.
Ar - A request? Do you take things like that?
Ri - Yes. This is crucial for sustaining this miserable existence.
Ar - Don't be like that, I'm sure this must be better than being buried alive. 
Ri - Yeah. I was talking about everyone else though. 
Ar - ...
Ar - Can I see it?
Ri - Do as you wish. 
Ri - ...
Ri - There really is a malicious spirit in it. 
Ar - Woah, can you deal with it?
Ri - Hmph, who do you think I am?
Ri - Let's see...
Rilu chanted a spell and a small puff of smoke erupted from the statue in her hands.
To her surprise though, it swiftly dashed towards Arron quickly diving into him.
Ri - Oh...
Ar(shock) - What the hell? What just happened?
Ri - I think it invaded you.
Ri - It must be stronger than I anticipated.

Ar(neutral) - Can you help with this? You surely can, right?
Ar(shock) - It's your fault I was cursed in the first place!

Ar(neutral) - No way. I can't let anyone else know about it.
Ri - ... 
Ri - I see. I'll do it then. 
Ri - Excuse my inexperience.
Freeing Arron from his pants, Rilu began to clumsy feel up his penis with her hands.
Ri - ...
Ri - It seems to twitch a bit.
Ar - This is a good sign, right?
Ri - Perhaps.
After another half minute, Rilu backed off dropping her cloak on the floor.
Ri - Lay down.
With a feeling of uneasiness, Arron landed on the bed.

Rilu awkwardly positioned herself on top of him facing away. 
Letting out a small gasp she pressed her naked rear against his flaccid cock.
Ar - What are you doing...?
Ri - Quiet. You should concentrate now.
Ri - It blocks out your sexual energy, so to dampen it you need to have someone else's energy until it breaks.
Ri - This is why I said you should ask someone else.
Ri - This is the first time I've done something like this...
Rilu began to grind her bare crotch against Arron.
Ar - ...
Ar - (Maybe I should have. She's pretty clumsy.)
Ar - (Although, she doesn't seem to mind too much.)
Ri - Mh... Like this?
Ar - (Oh, I can feel her getting wetter.)
Ar - (This actually isn't too bad.)
Ri - Nhhh… this feels weird...
Even without seeing Rilu's face Arron still could tell her voice was showing more feeling.
His cock gets warmer with every brush of her pussy over it.
Rilu’s breath grew more ragged as her juices covered Arron's penis.
Ar - Oooh!
=ABG rilu_cowgirl_2 rilu_cowgirl_3=
With a flash through his mind, he felt the evil energy leave his body instantly making his cock rock hard and suddenly enter Rilu.
Ri - Ahhh!
Ar - Woah, You did it Rilu! I feel like its gone.
Ri - Nhhh... It went inside...
Being full of Arron's cock Rilu weakly twitched, unsure what to do.
Arron spotted her confusion and decided to take initiative.
Ar - But we better make sure it's fully functional, right?
Ri - What are you...
Arron helped Rilu by supporting her body from the back and slowly moving in turn.
Ar - It won't feel right leaving you excited like this.
Ri - Nnh? Ah...
Ar - I should also make you feel good as thanks for your work.
Ri - Arron... 
Ri - Ahh!
Arron slowly pushed himself in and out of Rilu.
Ar - No surprise, you are pretty tight.
Ri - You’re stirring up my insides... Nhhh...
Ri - I feel so weird...
Ar - You really don't have any experience do you? Well then I’ll have to make this a night you’ll always remember.

Ro - The person is referred to as the Traveler. They are thought to be some sort of powerful mage or even a mysterious entity.
Ar - Interesting. So you say there's a chance that Traveler is a cute girl? 
Ro(sarcastic) - Sure, if that makes you motivated. 
Ro - The only issue is we don't really have any leads. There's one book with a quite detailed description, though.
Ro - An artifact named "Saint’s Pearl". It's rumored to have great power and is associated with the Traveler somehow. 
Ro - Perhaps we should investigate it at least.

Ro - No way...

Annet's hand reached between Erika's legs entering the damp walls of her pussy.
=ABG annet_erika_8 annet_erika_9=
An - So wet already.
Er - Ah...
An - Aren't you happy you get to play with your Mistress after so long?
Despite her resistance, Erika's legs slowly spreaded, allowing Annet easier access to her slit.
An - Ah-ha-ha, just look at this. 
An - After all these words you willingly let yourself be molested even without my request.
Er - I'm!.. No... Ah!! 
Increasing her tempo, Annet brought Erika to climax.
After that she lost any power to speak coherently.
Her mind regressed back to the times when she was fully controlled by Annet.
An - You are such a nice meat hole.
An - Cumming like this from being raped. 
Annet was gloating even without Erika fully recognizing what she said.
That was what she really enjoyed in the whole ordeal.
An - Time to give you the thing you've been waiting for.
Er - ...
=ABG annet_erika_10 annet_erika_11=
After a few moments Erika felt something long and hard entering her pussy.
Annet, wearing strap-on, grabbed the defenseless Erika from behind.
Er - Aah!..
An - Have you been missing this feeling, you whore?
An - Your cunt squeezing me so hungrily.
An - Ha-ha, and to think I was worried you'd actually become a decent person!
=ABG annet_erika_12 annet_erika_13=
Annet began thrusting into Erika's wet pussy.
An - Take this!
Er - Ohh... Yes... 
Er - More... Fuck my cunt harder...
An - Yes, you elf slut, I'll put you back in shape in no time.
An - I've missed having good toys to play with.
Er - Ngh... 
Er - Ah... Mistress...
An - Yes, shake your hips like that.

Er - The elf whore is...
Er - Going to... cum again...
An - Good, let's finish this.

Str - Yeah, the city committee member, the one with horns.
Ar - Oh, right, that one.
Ar - What she's even about?
Str - Don't know much, really. 
Str - She was elected due to her business influence and money mostly.
Str - I think she's from an aristocratic family, or that's what she looks like anyway. 
Ar - Don't you find her weird though? 
Ar - Those horns and tail I mean.
Ar - She kinda looks like a succubus to me.
Str - Hey man, not cool. We aren’t prejudiced.
Str - Anyone can be a good person.
Str - Especially when they have lots of money.
Ar - Uh huh, I guess we should check her estate then.

An - But there might be some difficulties.
Ar(neutral) - Such as?
An - You see, she's an old friend of mine and we have just reunited.
An - She wants to stay with me.
Ro - Does she really?

Er(sad) - You don't have to stay here.
Ro(shock) - Huh?
=SPRITE annet=
An - As you see, she's perfectly fine and stays here by her will.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, this does look a bit fishy.
Ro - ....
An - You are a clever man, Mr. Arron. 
An - You do look different from most people in this city. 
An - I can tell you aren't of lowly heritage.
Ar - Please, you are making me blush.
An - I'm not flattering you. 
An - I can see how others react to you, especially your companions. 
An - Rose, correct? 
Ro - ...
An - You see, to me there are two kinds of people in this world.
An - Those who rule and those who obey. 
An - Erika is obeying me, just as Rose obeys you.
An - That makes us alike, don't you think? 
Ro(sarcastic) - This is absurd.
Ar - Shush, don't make me bring your gag with us next time.
Ro(shock) - .....!
An - Ha, see! You get it.
An - You have come to me so you do hold interest in Erika. 
An - Since she has joined you before, you must be a responsible leader.
An - So I'm not wholly against letting her go.
An - But I do need someone around to help me with my... business.
An - Your girl, Rose, looks quite capable of that. 
An - What would you say if we switch for an uncertain period of time?
Ro(shock) - ..!
Rose noticed how Erika's eyes screamed "No", but did not say anything.
She was terrified by the idea of being left alone with Annet.
Ar(neutral) - This is a tempting offer...
Ar - But I'll have to consider it first.
Ar - If that's fine with you.
Ro - *C-consider?*
An - Of course not. 
An - Once you decide, I'll be waiting. 
An - I hope we can have a productive relationship in future.
Ar - Likewise.

An - I'm glad that you've visited me.
An - I hope you don't think of me badly because of what I said.
An - In no way have I tried to degrade you.
Ro(talk) - N-no, I understand. 
Ro - I've come on my own here. Master, I mean, Arron would not let me go.
Ro(talk) - But I want to help Erika. 
An - I can assure you, Erika is in great condition.
Ro - I'll stay with you, if you let her go.
An - *Ho my, this is perfect*
An - Sure, this is very nice of you. 
An - If you become my subordinate, I'll let Erika leave.
Ro - Okay, I will. But... 
Ro - I want to see that she's fine. 
An - Sure thing. 
An - We can visit her right now.
An - Please, follow me. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Annet and Rose went to the prison cells where Erika was held captive.
An - You know, I quite adore reserved girls like you.
An - *You are really fun to play with.*
An - But what about Arron?
An - Isn't he going to return for you?
Ro(sarcastic) - H-He does not own me anymore. 
Ro(talk) - I'm free to decide what to do.
An - Ah, is that so. 
An - You do have some unusual features, must catch quite a bit of attention.
Ro - T-that's not true. 
Ro - It's nice that you appreciate it, though.
An - *Hah, she takes my attention as a benefit*
An - *Maybe I should take her right here*
An - *maybe even next to Erika...*
An - We are here. As you can see, she's perfectly fine.
Behind the cell bars a girl's silhouette rests in the shadows.
Ro(talk) - Erika? Is that you?
Annet has put Erika's in shackles just in case she might attempt to escape.
Ro - C-can I see her closer?
An - Alright, I have a key with me.
An - Just let me unlock this...
*click*
*thud*

Annet fell to the ground knocked out with Rose standing behind as she was unlocking the cell door. 
Rose held a small blackjack in her hand, which just got intimately acquainted with Annet’s head

Ro - Keys... Hold on, Erika.
Er(sad) - ...?

Em - A-ha, it's nothing. 
Em - I'm glad I could be useful.
Er(sad) - I... was sure that I wouldn't see you again any time soon.
Ar - It was Rose's plan. 
Er(sad) - ...Rose? You risked yourself for me?
Ar - You must've fooled her well acting like prey.
Ro - It was rather scary.
Ro - I felt like she could easily push me around, if I were any younger.
Ro(sarcastic) - Or you haven't been pushing me around since childhood.
Ar - Filthy lies.
Er(sad) - I... I'm not sure I'll be able to ever repay you for this.
Er(sad) - But now you might get into trouble with city government.
Ar(neutral) - I don't think she's going to go that far.
Ar - Not until she's ready to proclaim what she was doing to you anyway.
Ar - And it's not like it's my first time getting into fights with local authorities.
Ro(sarcastic) - Please, don't make me remember.
Ar - We haven't even turned anything to cinders this time.
Er - Thank you, Rose. 
Er - I actually thought you would be happy with me gone too.
Ro(talk) - Stop it. I wouldn't feel right leaving you like that.
Ro(talk) - And I don't think bad of you, it's just... I'm...
Ro - Umh...

Arron sat at the table with a huge stack of paper he was going through.
Ar(neutral) - Complaint, complaint, complaint, credit application, complaint, credit...
Ar(neutral) - A request to invade a neighbor village...
Ar(neutral) - What the hell... It's like I'm still back at the kingdom, reading nobles' complaints. 
Ar - I should've made Rose take care of those. 
Ar - Who even taught goblins to write anyway?
Arron rose up and left the table. 
As he undressed preparing to sleep, an unexpected vision unveiled before him.
=MUSIC erotheme=
=ABG rilu_minet_1=
Ri - Hey, you don't mind some company at this time, do you?
Ar - Eh...? Rilu? 
Before him a half-naked Rilu stands at his? knees, lustly reaching for his manhood.
Ri - I'm in a bit of trouble here...
Ar - I don't remember you having animal ears.
Ri - Um, yes... 
Ri - Well, this is embarrassing...
Ar - More embarrassing than being naked? 
Ri - I've got possessed by a cat spirit.
Ri - And the poor thing was in heat.
Ri - It's hard to control myself...
Ar - Understood, you can rely on me.
=ABG rilu_minet_2=
Ri - Let me make you feel good.
Rilu stack out her tongue and slowly licked over Arron's cock like it's candy.
Ri - *slurp*
Ar - Ouch.
Ar - Slow down a bit, your tongue is rough.
Ri - Sorry *slurp* I'm not thinking very straight.
Ri - This smell... 
Ri - Drives me crazy.
=ABG rilu_minet_3 rilu_minet_4=
As Rilu feverishly worked over Arron's cock, her other hand was rubbing her pussy.
Ar - Mh.. It's unusual to see you being this proactive.
Ri - *slurp* You don't like it? 
Ar - Don't be silly. 
Ar - Variety like this is never bad.
Ri - I'm glad.
Ri - Let me try this...
=ABG rilu_minet_5 rilu_minet_6=
After saying that, Rilu took the whole thing into her mouth.
Ri - Mhm..
Her moans grew more exciting as she awkwardly coiled on Arron's penis.
Ar - Damn.
Ri - Mhmmmm... Thu likh ith? 
Ar - Oh... 
Ar - If you continue like this...
Ri - *slurp*
Not hearing, or probably even ignoring him, Rilu blissfully sucked his cock.
Ri - Come on.
Ri - *slurp* I want your milk...
Ar - Hah, won't make a girl wait.
Ar - Since you asked for it.
Ri - Mhmmm...

Ri - Thanks.
Ri - But I can't wait any longer.

Ri - Aaah!..
Ar - Are you alright? 
Ri - Y-yes, sorry...
Ri - I've been waiting for this for too long.
Ar - You never raised your voice like that.
Ar - And your pussy is incredibly wet.
Ri - Mmmhm...
Ar - Jee, you are so impatient now you are moving on your own.
Ri - ...Your thing inside...
Ri - It's so hard.
Ar - You turned into a really naughty kitten.

Ar - Phew...
Ar - What do you have on your mind then?
Ri - Before we met, I never cared much for sex.
Ri - Never was interested in it either.
Ar(neutral) - You did it though.
Ri - Not so much did it, as it was done to me.
Ar(neutral) - Eh?
Ri - Arron, not everyone out there was as nice to me as you.
Ri - Most people usually ostracized and feared me. 
Ri - Some because of my condition.
Ri - Some because of my practices.
Ri - And many did torture me, while some had experiments.
Ar(neutral) - This sounds awful.
Ar(neutral) - I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
Ri - Don't be, I've gotten used to it after all.
Ri - Probably because of it I never had much interest in intimacy.
Ri - Or so I thought.
Ri - Then there was that incident with the... Well...
Ar - Potency restoration.
Ri - i didn't expect it would be a very different experience to me. 
Ri - So much, that I started to think about it.
Ri - A... lot, actually. 
Ri - But even though I was interested in it now, I had no idea how to talk about it.
Ar - Hah, so you are kinda like Rose at that.
Ri - What do you mean?
Ar - Nevermind.
Ar - So I take it, you used a cat spirit as an excuse.
Ri - Yes. 
Ri - It was a bit unbearable at the time. 
Ri - I'm sorry about deceiving you.
Ar - Don't worry, that was a pleasure for me.
Ri - ... I'm glad you feel that way. 
Ar - You don't have to hold back if you need it at any time.

Ri - I'll be feared and hunted again in no time.
Ri - This is the cycle of my life, and I hate it. 
Ri - I hate people and nothing is better than ending it once for all.

Ar(neutral) - I don't believe you.

Ar(neutral) - You are right. I can't understand how terrible your suffering was. 
Ar(neutral) - But I do understand that it's bad enough to make you wish to end the world.
Ar(neutral) - It must be why you show so few emotions too.
Ar(neutral) - Must really put off the bastards who tortured you for fun.

Ar(neutral) - But you are also lying through your teeth.
Ar(neutral) - You aren't evil, and you absolutely don't hate people. You hardly used us either.
Ri - You are not making any sense.
Ar(neutral) - Despite all hardships you don't blame others.
Ar(neutral) - And you don't show any real grudge towards them.
Ar(neutral) - You care for me and you cared enough to save Iola, even though you hardly knew her.
Ar(neutral) - You pretend to be evil, because this way you hope to make me reject you.
Ar(neutral) - So you would have an easier time doing what you've planned
Ar - But I won't hate you. 
Ar - And I'm sure the other villagers and girls like you as well.
Ri(talk) - ...Shut up.
Ar(neutral) - What happened to you is unfortunate... No, terrible. 
Ar - But I can swear to you that nobody will abuse you as long as I live.
Ar - This might be not much for you, but this much I can guarantee.

I - I'm on the pilgrimage.
I - Actually, I was supposed to do it at a different time, but the Cult ruled for me to do it now.
I - I feel like it was father's initiative though. 
I(sad) - He acts differently since the time he returned.
Ar - What sort of pilgrimage?
I - I was requested to get Spirit Essence for the cult. 
I - So I thought maybe I could ask you to get it?
Ar - But isn't that supposed to be a task you have to complete personally? 
I - No, not really. Cult just uses initiates to gather it for future sellings.
I - Many do just buy it or hire someone to get it.
Ar - That's creative.
Ar - But what do you even need that for?
I - We make aphrodisiac out of it.
Ar - Hooh. An important industry for sure.
Ar(neutral) - It's fine if you are paying, but we might need some tips where to find it.

Ri - According to the rumors it is brimming with stray undead.
Ro(sarcastic) -  Of course.
Ri - We are likely to find it there.

Ar - Likewise. 
Pulling out of Iola, Arron finally moved to the girl who had been left waiting this whole time.
Ar - You must be bouncing off the walls, Rose. 
Ro - ...Just do it already.
Ar - Come on, don't be so distant.
Ar - You'd be spoiling the fun for others.

Ar - You've been fighting back so much, but this seems to really excite you.
Ro - It's not like that... 
Ro - Ah...

Ro - Yes...

Ar - Just look at this.
Ar - We are turning our meek Rose into a passionate whore.

Er - Well it's often more exciting when you aren't prepared for it.

The huge dragon brought his head closer to the ground and observed Ember.
Dr - Ooh, why haven't you said so sooner. 
Ar - Because of your senile deafness.
Dr - Quiet. You'll be worse than me in mere decades.
Ar - ...So now you can hear.
Dr - You have a familiar scent.
Dr - What's your name, child?
Em - I'm Ember. Nice to meet you.
Em - Even though we've fought already. 
Dr - I see... You are the child of Ezet. 
Dr - Truly a wonder to meet someone like you. 
Em - Ezet? Is that the name of my mother?
Dr - Yes. You have no knowledge of your ancestry? A pity.
Dr - Ezet was one of our wyer. But it's from a time before we were facing today's crisis. 
Ro - What crisis? 
Dr - Hmm... I'll need time to explain.
Dr - We dragons possess souls unlike normal mortals. Andh these souls grant us sentience. 
Dr - When a dragon dies, his soul leaves his body and finds its way to a new one.
Dr - Without a soul, we are but beasts. You've met many of those on your way here. 
Dr - From some time ago something has changed. 
Dr - Dead dragons have been reborn less and less. Somehow, their souls can't find a way back here.
Em(tired) - No way.
Dr - I haven't seen anyone here for the last few years. I fear that we might be hunted. 
Dr - But it feels like... You might have Ezet's soul inside of you.
Dr - Somehow she managed to conceal herself inside of you.
Em - My mother inside of me? So I'm her?
Dr - No. It would be more accurate to say that she lays dormant, perhaps occasionally influencing your actions. 
Ro(talk) - Then that note was likely her doing.
Em - So that means... My mother is dead? 
Dr - Yes and no, her body is likely dead, but her soul is within you for now. 
Dr - I hope she will eventually be reborn as we once were.
Dr - Although I did not expect her to take a... Mortal partner. 
Dr - At times like these I will not complain. 
Dr - My name is Qothus.
Dr - I welcome you as one of my kin. 
Ar - Before you continue with the family reunion, there's one thing we need to ask for.
Dr - Yes?
Ro - We are currently looking for someone...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Dr - Curious story, but my knowledge is not enough to help you here. 
Dr - I don't know anything about that person or item you possess.
Ar - Well damn. At least I've defeated a dragon today. What do you think father would say?
Ro - Now that you say it, we actually did...
Ar - Well, Ember, take your time, we will be waiting around the corner.
Party leaves Ember alone with the Qothus.
Em - I didn't expect this would turn out like this.
Dr - Threads of destiny are often chaotic in nature.
Dr - Your mate is strong, you've chosen wisely.
Em - Wha-? Sir Arron is not my...
Dr - Or was it Ezet's influence, I wonder.
Em - Um, could you tell me about my mother?
Dr - Oh, she was one nasty rascal.
Dr - And a fool unlike others. 
Dr - Always got into fights with others. One time she even scorched Elder's nest cave.
Dr - ...
Dr - Shame I won't see her again.
Em - You were related?
Dr - We are all siblings in a sense.
Em - Ah, so I can call you an Uncle Qothus then?
Dr - This is...
Em - Please?
Dr - *sigh* Alright.
Em - But what should I do now?
Dr - You look quite accustomed to mortals. 
Dr - You should naturally stay with them now.
Dr - In truth, I don't know if we will even continue to exist for much longer.
Dr - I haven't seen or heard of anyone for a long time until you came.
Dr - So go, glide proudly and remember what you are. 
Dr - Don't shy away from returning here if you need help. 
Dr - I may look old, but a few more centuries are nothing for me.

T - Did you say that the cult is searching for demons invading this world?
I - Yes. 
T - No, this is wrong. 
I(shock) - Eh?
T - Demons do not invade this world in physical form. 
T - They can't leave their dimension at will and enter here.
T - What they do instead is influence and corrupt other beings. In some cases to an extreme degree.
T - Like local dwarves who turned into bloodthirsty maniacs, or faeries being massive bitches.
Ar(neutral) - That explains quite a lot. 
I(sad) - I had no idea. What are demons really then?
T - They are entities from another dimension, who generally seek a life energy which they feed on. 
T - Violence, negative emotions, things like this. They would gladly enter this world but most aren't powerful enough for that. 
T - Once defeated they return to their realm, but strong light power can kill them entirely.
T - From the sound of it, I'd guess your father isn't quite himself anymore. 
T - But spare me from these worldly worries. Is there something else?

Ro - This is disgusting. 
D - Thanks. But I didn't ask your opinion on that.
Ro - What do you want of me?
D - I have a proposal for you.

D - To put it briefly, I offer you to take the place of Annet. 
D - After her death there's some gap in ranks. 
D - You could fit right in and have the same powers she had.
D - In return you'll only have to pledge your loyalty to me.
D - Given that it will save you from the eventual demise of your kind, I see it as an extremely nice offer.

Ro - I see an exit.
Ar - Finally. Let's see what's there.

The group entered a small building filled with books and unknown devices.
=SPRITE caliban=
Ro(shock) - Ah!
C - Ah. 
Ar(shock) - It's Zelroth's minion!
C - Oh, it's you guys.
Ri - He looks somewhat different.
Ar(neutral) - You are not going to fight us?
C - No, I'd rather not.
Ar - You also talk differently.
Ar - Where's Zelroth then?
C - He's no more. I've absorbed his intelligence. 
C - Must thank you for that opportunity. 
Ro(talk) - But what are you doing here then? 
C - Studying. I've been having an unusual thirst for knowledge recently. 
C - Humans here had a really advanced understanding of the world and nature.
Ar(neutral) - Well, if you aren't going to fight we should move on.
C - ....Hold on. 
C - Are you still planning to fight Dimitrius?
Ar - Do we look like we have any other option?
C - You hardly have any chances on your own at his current power.
Ar - So what, do you suggest we  give up?
C - No, I actually want to offer you some help.
Ro - Why? How do we even trust you?
C - I'm not one of them and it's only a matter of time after they finish you off that they get to me.
C - And they are not going to like what I did.
C - Between you and the demons I'd clearly prefer your dominance.
Ar(neutral) - Fair enough, I don't mind letting you go free.
Ar(neutral) - As long as you aren't going to repeat Zelroth's deeds. Caliban, was it?
C - No, actually I've chosen a new name for me. Now I'm Cyrex.
Ar - Alright, Cyrex, so what can you offer.
C - I'm not going to help you personally, but there still might be a way to defeat Dimitrius.
C - Although, it's not going to be simple at all.
Ar - Something is better than nothing.
C - Good. Then, you must be aware that demons are weak to light.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
The team has made preparations and moved to their new destination while Dimitrius still had no idea where they are.

D - Still don't understand that you can't defeat me.
Ar(shock) - Damnit. You guys escape, I'll hold him back.
D(anger) - ...Seriously?
D - Fine, I'll play with you for the last time, Arron.
*snap*
A number of demon minions jumped from the outside into the building. 
Ar(anger) - Gh...
D - Go after them!
D - Now I made you look like an idiot. Ahaha!
Ar(neutral) - We'll see about that, asshole.
Saying that, Arron turned his back and ran away.
D(anger) - ...?
D - This imbecile never learns.

Meanwhile Rose and Erika moved through the lab’s upper floors.
Ro - Come on, come on.
Ro(talk) - Erika, you sure you remember the map?
Er - Of course, elves have an excellent photographic memory. 
Er - Or so I was told anyway.
Ro(talk) - Please, we are in a dire situation here. 
Er - I'm kidding, it should be around this corner. 
=SPRITE demon=
Demon - Arrgh!
Ro(shock) - Oh no, they found us!
Er(sad) - I guess we will have to fight through them.

Ro - We made it...
Er - Yes, come in, it's after this door.
Ro(talk) - Great.
Rose and Erika entered the room filled with glowing glass screens.
Er - Alright, it's your turn.
Ro - Uh... This might take some time.
Er - You sure you can manage it?
Ro(sarcastic) - No, it would help if you could help me out too.
Er - You know I'm too stupid for this stuff.
Ro - ...Just let Rilu know we got there. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Meanwhile Arron kept escaping from Dimitrius.
After making through another room he ended up in a small room connected to a giant curved structure.
Without taking a pause he opened a small hatch and jumped inside, sealing it shut behind him.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=BG future_city_reactor_inside=
=SPRITE demitrius=
Right as he finished, Dimitrius predictably appeared next to him. 
=SOUND slash=
Arron attempted to land a surprise attack, but Dimitrius blocked it.
Ar(anger) - Damn you.
D - It seems your brilliance is finally overshadowed by your human nature.
D - What a stupid thing to trap yourself in this place even though I can easily  teleport.
Dimitrius was correct, they appeared to be inside of an isolated curving tunnel only spacious enough to allow one person running in it.
Ar(anger) - ...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=BG future_city_reactor=
=SPRITE rilu=
Meanwhile Ember, Rilu and Iola ran from the other side of the tunnel. 
Ri - Ember, give it to me.
Em - Sure.
Ember passed Rilu a small piece of red cloth that she managed to rip off Dimitrius' outfit during the fight.
Ri - Erika said they got to the control room as well.
Ri - Iola, you can start making your preparations.
I - Got it!
=SPRITE demon=
Demon - Arghh!
Em - Oh no, they found us!
Ri - We have no time for this.

Em - Looks like it was the last of them.
Ri - Good, now time to start the preparations.
I - Understood. How's Arron doing?
Ri - He's struggling, we should hurry.
Em - What should I do?
Ri - Stay on guard.
Em - Okay!

D - Exhausted from running in circles? 
D - Too bad you are only a weak human.

Arron threw another strike but Dimitirus blocked it.
Ar(anger) - Gh, you are really starting  to get on my nerves.
D - Ahaha, great, let's fool around for the last time!

=SOUND sword_fall=
After a few clashes Dimitrius has managed to strike Arron's sword from his hands.
Ar(shock) - Ah!
D - And it's over.
Ar(anger) - Like hell it is!
Taken by surprise, Dimitrius was attacked by barehanded Arron, throwing him on the ground.
=SOUND tumble=
What he didn't see is how Arron pulled the shock baton out of his clothes.
D(anger) - What the-
=SOUND shocker=
Bzzzzt
D(anger) - Arrggh... You bastard...
As the baton was connected to Dimitrius body, electrical shock ran through his body completely immobilizing and depowering him to the point he couldn't speak easily.
Ar - Hah, so it does work on you after all. 
D(anger) - You... Will pay for this...
Arron kept Dimitrius in one spot as electrical current continued to restrict him.
Ar(neutral) - You know what really gets on my nerves? 
D(anger) - You are... just postponing the inevitable...
Ar(neutral) - It's your trash attitude towards us. 
D(anger) - You still... can't kill me...
Ar(neutral) - Humans aren't the animals you take us for.
D(anger) - And once energy... runs out...
Ar(neutral) - I actually believe we can achieve great things.
D(anger) - You will... fucking die...
Ar(neutral) - You aren't even listening. 
Ar - Well, at least you won't tell it to others.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=

Meanwhile Rose has finally grasped the controls of the reactor. 
Ro(talk) - Alright, I'm starting it.
Er - Roger, I'll let Rilu know.
Ro - Master, please be safe.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=SPRITE rilu=
Ri - ...It's starting.
Ri(talk) - Iola, wait for my signal.
I - O-okay!
Rilu began to chant the spell, as lights around the structure began to work.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=

=SPRITE demitrius=
As Arron kept Dimitrius disabled, he sensed how the mechanisms around him went into motion and small lights turned on.
Ar(neutral) - It seems I don't have much time left. 
D - ...Hah... starting to regret... your arrogance?
Ar(neutral) - I've heard that demons hate light. 
D(anger) - (Keep talking fool, I only need a bit more to break free)
Ar - You might have no idea, but this weird place is called a fusion reactor. 
D(anger) - Watcha... talking about...
Ar - Amazingly, it is able to eminate the power of the Sun itself.
Ar - Given your condition, it seems my shocker has nearly run out of power. 
Ar - So, say, do you think you will be able to survive fifty millions degree heat?
D - Enough!
Dimitrius pushed Arron away with a slowly returning power, still oblivious to what was going on around him. 
=SOUND fall=
Ar(shock) - Behind!
Realizing that Arron indeed saw something behind him, Dimitrius looked around to find a huge cloud of forming plasma spreading through the reactor's coil.
In the same moment Arron disappeared from his previous place.
D(anger) - ...Teleportation?
D - You fool, did you forget who I am?
D - ...
D(anger) - Huh?
D(anger) - Something stops me? 
D(anger) - HOW!?
D(anger) - ARR-
=SPRITE_HIDE=
As the reactor fully powered, plasma erased his body without a trace.
=BG future_city_reactor=
=SPRITE arron=
Ar - Thanks Iola, that was rather close.
I - N-no problem, we were lucky.
Ri(talk) - Yes, thankfully it worked. 
Ri - His teleportation wasn't that different from the  faeries, only extremely powerf-
=SOUND explosion=
=SHAKE_SCREEN 1=
Ar(neutral) - Oh-uh.
Em - What's happening?
Ri(talk) - Rose says the reactor had a leakage, we should run before the building collapses.
Ar(neutral) - Will they be alright?
Ri - Yes, let's go.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=BG future_city=
=SPRITE rose=
Ro(talk) - We made it!
Ro - Look, demons are gone. 
Ri - Yes, with Dimitrius dead the dimensions are no longer connected. 
Ar - Nice work. Time to go home then. 
Em - Huh... Is this place going to stay in our world though?
Ar - Not my problem. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=

=SPRITE flak=
Ar - Hey, we are back and alive.
F - Nice to see you then, ex-mayor.
Ar(neutral) - ...What do you mean, 'ex-mayor'?
F - Oh, we have elected a new mayor since you were gone and we had no idea if you are even alive.
Ar(shock) - WHAAAT?!
F - There he is by the way.
=SPRITE caliban=
Ar - ...Eh? How?
F - Well, he said that he will stop the end of the world if we get him elected. 
C - Oh, Hi Arron. How are you doing?
Ar - ...I'll fucking murder you. 
Ar(shock) - It was me who stopped the end of the world, not him!
G - Yeah, sure, you weren't even around most of the time.
Ar(shock) - I-
Ro(talk) - Master, isn't it fine? We have to return home soon anyway.
Ar(neutral) - ......
Ar(neutral) - Whatever. But how do you plan to do it? Dimitrius is gone now.
I - Umh, I think I've some of those powers, when he died I felt like they went into me. 
I(sad) - Maybe because we were related.
I - I think I'll be able to transfer you back to your world.
F - Well now, don't be so rushy, we surely can celebrate your return before you go.
Ar - ...Thanks.
