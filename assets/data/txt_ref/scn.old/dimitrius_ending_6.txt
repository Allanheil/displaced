De - Ghah, you idiots. 
De - Still don't understand that you can't defeat me.

A number of demon minions jumped from the outside into the building. 
Ar(anger) - Gh...
De - Go after them!
De - Now I made you look like an idiot. Ahaha!
Ar(neutral) - We'll see about that, asshole.

Meanwhile Rose and Erika moved through the labâ€™s upper floors.
Ro - Come on, come on.
Ro(talk) - Erika, you sure you remember the map?

Er - I'm kidding, it should be around this corner.

Demon - Arrgh!
Ro(shock) - Oh no, they found us!
Er(sad) - I guess we will have to fight through them.
