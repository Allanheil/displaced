Ar - Hey, we dealt with that dwarf issue. 
Guard - Which dwarf issue? 
Ar(neutral) - The one you told us to take care of. Bloodthirsty dwarves and such, remember?
Guard - No idea what you are talking about.
Ar - Carl, please, you are really getting on my nerves.
Guard_2 - I'm not Carl. That guy was kicked out a few days ago.
Ar(neutral) - Argh... Whatever. We've dealt with dwarves, now let us pass. We had an agreement.
Guard_2 - Look, I don't know anything about the agreement. And Iâ€™m only seeing you for the first time.
Guard_2 - You are free to pass through. No idea what that moron Carl said to you, but the entrance is free. 
Ar - ......
Ro - It's all good, we can enter the city now, right?
Ar(neutral) - That bastard was really lucky his face was hidden by a helmet.
