Ro - Okay, we've searched through the central library. 
Ar(neutral) - So what have you found?
Ro - We've gone through Rilu's description and only found very scarce mentions to someone matching it. 
Ro - The person is referred to as the Traveler. They are thought to be some sort of powerful mage or even a mysterious entity.
Ar - Interesting. So you say there's a chance that Traveler is a cute girl? 
Ro(sarcastic) - Sure, if that makes you motivated. 
Ro - The only issue is we don't really have any leads. There's one book with a quite detailed description, though.
Ro - An artifact named "Saintâ€™s Pearl". It's rumored to have great power and is associated with the Traveler somehow. 
Ro - Perhaps we should investigate it at least.
Er - Oh, I know where we can find it. 
Ro(shock) - You do? Tell us!
Er - Hmmm... But what would I get from it?
Ro - *Sigh* What do you want?
Er - A night together?
Ro - No.
Er - A kiss?
Ro - No. 
Er - Can I touch your fluffy tail at least, then? 
Ro(sarcastic) - (I'm not getting out of this one, am I?)
Ro(talk) - Fine, just do it and tell us already.
Er - He-he, sure. 
Er - Don't worry, I'll be gentle...
=SHAKE_SPRITE 0.3=
Ro(shock) - ... Ah!
Er - Oh, sorry, I didn't expect you to be this sensitive.
Er - Mhmm it's really soft and nice to touch.
Ro(talk) - Enough, just tell us. 
Er - Okay... the Faery Queen has it in her possessions.
Ar - Faeries? Do you mean those small things in the forest?
Er - Yep. They are nasty little bastards.
Er - I'd not feel remorse tearing a few of their wings on the way there.
Ro - That seems a bit harsh for you.
Er - They mostly manage to earn it. And they grow back with time after all.
Ar - You know how we can find her?
Er - Sure, but cornering her might be pretty hard.
Ar(neutral) - We'll figure something out once we get there.
