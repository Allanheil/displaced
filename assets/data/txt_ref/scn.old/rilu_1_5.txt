Ro(talk) - So there's no place or friends you can return to? How sad. 
Ri - Don't worry about it.
Ri - I've gotten used to it.
Ar - Make yourself at home, we still have some unoccupied rooms.
Ro - Your help was immeasurable, but I'm actually curious.
Ro - How come someone like you became a necromancer? 
Ri - .....
Ro - I mean in the tales necromancers are usually creepy evil old folk.
Ri - I've been studying my condition. 
Ar - Your immortality? 
Ri - Yes. 
Ri - Unfortunately I've only managed to kill myself another couple dozens of times.
Ro - ...
Ar - But your skills are rather useful. 
Ar - And more importantly, awesome.
Ro - Rilu... How old are you?
Ri - Hmm... I'm not sure. What year is it? 
Er - 34XX.
Ri - *pondering*
Ri - 600-ish something. 
Ri - I've had at least a few hundred combined in isolation though. 
Ro - ...
Ar - I bet you all wish youâ€™d stay this young for so long.
Ro(sarcastic) - I dunno about that.
Er - Nah, I'm good.
Ri - You shouldn't.

Ri - ...So, you say I can stay with you?
Ar - I'm not going to let alive friendly necromancer not join us.
Ro - If Master has set his mind on something, there's little reason to argue.
Er(happy) - Your harem seems to get weirder and weirder, Arron.
Ar - Plus, there's a thing you might be able to help us out with.
Ri - Yes?
Ar - You see...

As they finished explaining their problem, Rilu has harshly broken their hope.
Ri - I've never heard about such means of transportation.
Ri - However, there might be one person I know who might know something.
Ar - Huh? Wouldn't all people you know be feeding the worms?
Ri - Normally. That isn't as big of a deal as I could summon their spirits, but I'm not actually sure if he's dead. 
Ri - A few centuries ago there was a small religious group worshipping the deity. 
Ri - According to them, he was the creator of this world.
Ar - A title to aspire.
Ri - They did seem like just a bunch of lunatics, but I've actually met him before I met the group.
Ar - Did he look like the creator then?
Ri - No, but I've realized he's been living for much longer than me.
Ri - So I began to pursue him, to see if he knows something about my condition.
Ri - But he wasn't weak like me. And he knew nothing about it either.
Ri - I've seen him using teleportation with little effort.
Ri - He also insisted that he wouldn't interfere with anything going on around here.
Ar(neutral) - So you think he's not of this world as well?
Ri - Back then I thought it was the case. 
Ar(neutral) - That's actually something. Let's try to see what we can find then.
Ar - And thanks, Rilu.
Ri(blush) - ...Don't mention it.
