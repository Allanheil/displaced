A moderate crowd is gathered around one of the city entrances as if there was a parade.
Ar - Hmm? What's going on here?

=SPRITE victor=
Ro(talk) - We aren't quite locals. Who's that?
S - He's the strongest fighter around these lands. 
Ar - Nonsense, I'm the strongest fighter around these lands.
Ro(sarcastic) - No, you aren't. 
S - He almost single-handedly won the conclusive battle of the trade wars 15 years ago. 
S - And he has been defending the kingdom's peace all these years. 
Ar - Well, isn't he popular.
S - He sure is! Despite his age, he has no contenders in the arena or in training.
Ar - Are you in his fan club or something?
S - ... Maybe, what's it to you?
Ar - Okay, this is getting silly.
Ar - Let's go already, there's nothing to do here.
Ar - .....
Ar - Maybe I'll start my own fanclub eventually.
Ro(sarcastic) - I don't think that's how it works.
Em - Oh, you gonna have a fanclub? Can I join!?
Ar - Sure, once we start our campaign for world domination we can use all the help we can get.
Em - Eh? What's world domination? 
Ro(sarcastic) - Ignore it Ember, it's not important.
Ar - Hmph. Don't make me reconsider your second-in-command position, Rose.

The annual meeting is being held at the city hall. 
The hall is filled with nobles and the richest people of the region.

CM - Do you acknowledge it? 
N - Yes, but it wasn't my fault. 
N - My storage was set on fire!

Taking a day off Erika walks through Aeros' market.

M - Looking for something specific?
Er - Nah, Just checking around.
M - Oh right, you are from that desert village. 
M - You don't have to dress that skimpy around here though. 
Er - Don't worry, it's one of my favorite outfits.
M - A-ha, alright then.
Elf Child - No, please let us go!
Erika turned to the noise from the other side of the market.
A pair of captured children, no older than twelve, were sold to an obese rich man.
RN - Shut it, you cur.
RN - I've paid a good sum for you.
EC - *sob* Please, I want to see my mom.
RN - They are pretty unruly.
RN - Don't worry, you'll work off your price in bed and become real ta-

Before the man could notice it, Erika punched him into the face, quickly freeing the children after that.
Er - Run kids.
Without a second thought they disappeared into the crowds.
RN - You... Bitch! What do you think you are doing?!
Er(angry) - The right thing.
RN - You don't know who I am? I'm Hector Blackthrorn.
Hearing that name made people around pay more attention as it was one of the city's strongest families.
RN - Those slaves cost me 12 thousand gold.
RN - You better pay up now.
RN - Or should we turn you into the city guard.
Er(angry) - ...
Erika noticed how people were gathering around her, attracted by the ruckus.
RN - Hah, there's no way you can carry this much money in your garment though.
=SPRITE annet=
An - What's going on here, Hector?
Er - ...?
RN - Ms. Annet? It's nothing requiring your attention. 
RN - This elf just made me lose a pair of freshly bought slaves.
An(angry) - Trying to get your filthy hands on the poor kids again, are you?
An(angry) - That's disgusting, and it's only natural someone would want to save them.
RN - This is not against the law, and I paid fair and square. 
Rn - I demand my money back!
An(angry) - Hmph, fine. You'll have your gold, make sure it will serve something better than your perverted hobbies.
Hearing this, the previously distant crowd began cheering Annet.
Str - Wow, Ms. Annet really is a respectable committee member.
Str2 - This is what all rich and nobles should be like.
RN - Hmph, fine.
RN - Have it your way, this time. 
After receiving the confirmation letter, Hector walked away.
An - Now, that is taken care of...
An - I would like to have a word with you...
An - Your name is Erika, right?
Erika went numb from hearing her name. 
Her previous readiness to fight drains from her.
=BLACKFADE 0.5=
After a few minutes Erika was brought into Annet's mansion.
=MUSIC erotheme=
=ABG demon_erika_1=
=BLACKUNFADE 0.5=
In the middle of a dark cell Erika had Annet standing closely behind her.
An - Surely, it's been a long time, Erika. 
An - I wonder what have you been doing all this time.
Er - ...What do you want?
An - Well, aren't you uncharacteristically rude?
An - I guess it's only natural you'd lose some manners.
Er - .....
An - This will make things more fun.
=ABG demon_erika_2 demon_erika_3=
Annet possessively grabbed Erika from behind. 
Her hands moved over her breasts but Erika didn't stop her.
Er - Ngh... 
Against her will, Erika exhaled in a slightly excited manner.
An - Mhmm... Your body is as good as it was back there. 
An - Isn't it nice to be an elf?
An - Your firm tits are so nice to touch. 
An - Most elves are too bony.
An - It seems your body still remembers me well, Erika.
An - I can feel your nipples are very hard even through fabric. 
Er - ...No...
An - I had lots of fun playing with you.
Er - Stop it!
=ABG demon_erika_4 demon_erika_5=
Finally Erika tried to stop Annet's actions.
However Annet easily predicted it and Erika's hands were quickly cuffed above her.
An - Your behavior, on other hand...
An - I will have to train you back into a good obedient thing.
An - Just like you were.
Er - I don't want it...
An - We will see about that. 
Annet removed what little cloth was covering Erika's body, making her shiver.
=ABG demon_erika_6 demon_erika_7=
An - I'm betting my estate you will beg me to keep you around by tomorrow.
An - Because in the end, you are nothing but a little elven whore.
Er - ...You are wrong...
*Slap*
Annet's hand punished Erika with a hard slap on her butt, making her stop her protests.
An - Let's not make this too rough, dear. 
An - I want to save our reunion from needless cruelty. 
An - After all, this is the only thing you are good for.
Er - *sob*
An - Don't be sad, that's exactly how I like you.
An - And I can feel how this makes you horny.
Er - Ah...
Annet's hand reached between Erika's legs entering the damp walls of her pussy.
=ABG demon_erika_8 demon_erika_9=
An - So wet already.
Er - Ah...
An - Aren't you happy you get to play with your Mistress after so long?
Despite her resistance, Erika's legs slowly spreaded, allowing Annet easier access to her slit.
An - Ah-ha-ha, just look at this. 
An - After all these words you willingly let yourself be molested even without my request.
Er - I'm!.. No... Ah!! 
Increasing her tempo, Annet brought Erika to climax.
After that she lost any power to speak coherently.
Her mind regressed back to the times when she was fully controlled by Annet.
An - You are such a nice meat hole.
An - Cumming like this from being raped. 
Annet was gloating even without Erika fully recognizing what she said.
That was what she really enjoyed in the whole ordeal.
An - Time to give you the thing you've been waiting for.
Er - ...
=ABG demon_erika_10 demon_erika_11=
After a few moments Erika felt something long and hard entering her pussy.
Annet, wearing strap-on, grabbed the defenseless Erika from behind.
Er - Aah!..
An - Have you been missing this feeling, you whore?
An - Your cunt squeezing me so hungrily.
An - Ha-ha, and to think I was worried you'd actually become a decent person!
=ABG demon_erika_12 demon_erika_13=
Annet began thrusting into Erika's wet pussy.
An - Take this!
Er - Ohh... Yes... 
Er - More... Fuck my cunt harder...
An - Yes, you elf slut, I'll put you back in shape in no time.
An - I've missed having good toys to play with.
Er - Ngh... 
Er - Ah... Mistress...
An - Yes, shake your hips like that.
Er - I'm... cumming...
Er - The elf whore is...
Er - Going to... cum again...
An - Good, let's finish this.

Ar - Oh, right, that one.
Ar - What she's even about?
Str - Don't know much, really. 
Str - She was elected due to her business influence and money mostly.
Str - I think she's from an aristocratic family, or that's what she looks like anyway. 
Ar - Don't you find her weird though? 
Ar - Those horns and tail I mean.
Ar - She kinda looks like a succubus to me.
Str - Hey man, not cool. We aren’t prejudiced.

An - I see. Mr. Arron, right?
An - I do indeed know about Erika and where she is right now.
An - But there might be some difficulties.
Ar(neutral) - Such as?
An - You see, she's an old friend of mine and we have just reunited.
An - She wants to stay with me.

Ro(shock) - Huh?
=SPRITE annet=
An - As you see, she's perfectly fine and stays here by her will.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, this does look a bit fishy.
Ro - ....
An - You are a clever man, Mr. Arron. 
An - You do look different from most people in this city. 
An - I can tell you aren't of lowly heritage.
Ar - Please, you are making me blush.
An - I'm not flattering you. 
An - I can see how others react to you, especially your companions. 
An - Rose, correct? 
Ro - ...
An - You see, to me there are two kinds of people in this world.
An - Those who rule and those who obey. 
An - Erika is obeying me, just as Rose obeys you.
An - That makes us alike, don't you think? 
Ro(sarcastic) - This is absurd.
Ar - Shush, don't make me bring your gag with us next time.
Ro(shock) - .....!
An - Ha, see! You get it.
An - You have come to me so you do hold interest in Erika. 
An - Since she has joined you before, you must be a responsible leader.
An - So I'm not wholly against letting her go.
An - But I do need someone around to help me with my... business.
An - Your girl, Rose, looks quite capable of that. 
An - What would you say if we switch for an uncertain period of time?
Ro(shock) - ..!
Rose noticed how Erika's eyes screamed "No", but did not say anything.
She was terrified by the idea of being left alone with Annet.
Ar(neutral) - This is a tempting offer...
Ar - But I'll have to consider it first.
Ar - If that's fine with you.
Ro - *C-consider?*
An - Of course not. 
An - Once you decide, I'll be waiting. 
An - I hope we can have a productive relationship in future.
Ar - Likewise.

An - I hope you don't think of me badly because of what I said.
An - In no way have I tried to degrade you.
Ro(talk) - N-no, I understand. 
Ro - I've come on my own here. Master, I mean, Arron would not let me go.
Ro(talk) - But I want to help Erika. 
An - I can assure you, Erika is in great condition.
Ro - I'll stay with you, if you let her go.
An - *Ho my, this is perfect*
An - Sure, this is very nice of you. 
An - If you become my subordinate, I'll let Erika leave.
Ro - Okay, I will. But... 
Ro - I want to see that she's fine. 
An - Sure thing. 
An - We can visit her right now.
An - Please, follow me. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Annet and Rose went to the prison cells where Erika was held captive.
An - You know, I quite adore reserved girls like you.
An - *You are really fun to play with.*
An - But what about Arron?
An - Isn't he going to return for you?
Ro(sarcastic) - H-He does not own me anymore. 
Ro(talk) - I'm free to decide what to do.
An - Ah, is that so. 
An - You do have some unusual features, must catch quite a bit of attention.
Ro - T-that's not true. 
Ro - It's nice that you appreciate it, though.
An - *Hah, she takes my attention as a benefit*
An - *Maybe I should take her right here*
An - *maybe even next to Erika...*
An - We are here. As you can see, she's perfectly fine.
Behind the cell bars a girl's silhouette rests in the shadows.
Ro(talk) - Erika? Is that you?
Annet has put Erika's in shackles just in case she might attempt to escape.
Ro - C-can I see her closer?
An - Alright, I have a key with me.
An - Just let me unlock this...
*click*
*thud*
*fall*
Annet fell to the ground knocked out with Rose standing behind as she was unlocking the cell door. 
Rose held a small blackjack in her hand, which just got intimately acquainted with Annet’s head

Er(sad) - I... was sure that I wouldn't see you again any time soon.
Ar - It was Rose's plan. 
Er(sad) - ...Rose? You risked yourself for me?
Ar - You must've fooled her well acting like prey.
Ro - It was rather scary.
Ro - I felt like she could easily push me around, if I were any younger.
Ro(sarcastic) - Or you haven't been pushing me around since childhood.
Ar - Filthy lies.
Er(sad) - I... I'm not sure I'll be able to ever repay you for this.
Er(sad) - But now you might get into trouble with city government.
Ar(neutral) - I don't think she's going to go that far.
Ar - Not until she's ready to proclaim what she was doing to you anyway.
Ar - And it's not like it's my first time getting into fights with local authorities.
Ro(sarcastic) - Please, don't make me remember.
Ar - We haven't even turned anything to cinders this time.
Er - Thank you, Rose. 
Er - I actually thought you would be happy with me gone too.
Ro(talk) - Stop it. I wouldn't feel right leaving you like that.
Ro(talk) - And I don't think bad of you, it's just... I'm...

Ar - Eh...? Rilu? 
Before him a half-naked Rilu stands at his? knees, lustly reaching for his manhood.

Ar - I don't remember you having animal ears.
Ri - Um, yes... 
Ri - Well, this is embarrassing...

Ri - Sorry *slurp* I'm not thinking very straight.
Ri - This smell... 
Ri - Drives me crazy.

As Rilu feverishly worked over Arron's cock, her other hand was rubbing her pussy.
Ar - Mh.. It's unusual to see you being this proactive.

Ar - Don't be silly. 
Ar - Variety like this is never bad.

Not hearing, or probably even ignoring him, Rilu blissfully sucked his cock.

Ri - Some because of my practices.
Ri - And many did torture me, while some had experiments.
Ar(neutral) - This sounds awful.
Ar(neutral) - I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
Ri - Don't be, I've gotten used to it after all.
Ri - Probably because of it I never had much interest in intimacy.

Ri - i didn't expect it would be a very different experience to me. 
Ri - So much, that I started to think about it.
Ri - A... lot, actually. 
Ri - But even though I was interested in it now, I had no idea how to talk about it.
Ar - Hah, so you are kinda like Rose at that.
Ri - What do you mean?
Ar - Nevermind.
Ar - So I take it, you used a cat spirit as an excuse.
Ri - Yes. 
Ri - It was a bit unbearable at the time. 
Ri - I'm sorry about deceiving you.
Ar - Don't worry, that was a pleasure for me.
Ri - ... I'm glad you feel that way. 
Ar - You don't have to hold back if you need it at any time.
Ri - Can we do it today then?
Ar - You don't beat around the bush.
Ar - I think I have a fun idea.

Ri - This is somewhat embarrassing.
Ar - Doesn't it make you excited? 
Ri - ...
Ar - Now let me show you...

Arron pulled out a small wooden object.
Ri - That's...
Ar - A dildo.
Ri - Why...?
Ar - I want to play with you.
Ar - It's actually shaped like my dick. 
Ri - You really are a pervert.
Ar - Guilty. 
Ar - Now let's try to get it in...
=ABG rilu_anal_4 rilu_anal_5=
Arron slowly pushed a wooden dildo into Rilu's pussy.
Ri - Ngh...
Ar - Huh, you are quite wet already. 
Ar - It penetrated you easily.
Ri - It feels weird...
Ri - Ah!..
Ri - Why are you moving it...
Ar - You can't have sex without moving.
Ri - It feels good...
Ar - Of course, I'm a master at pleasing girls.
Ri - You can do it rougher.
Ar - Roger.
Ri - Ngh... Ah...
Ri - This is...
Ri - Feels similar to before...
Ri - A bit deeper.
Ar - You seem to really enjoy it.
Ri - I'm... I'm going to cum...
Ar - It's fine.
Ri - Aah, ahhh...

Ri - Hah... ah...
Ar - You look quite happy.
Ri - Stop teasing me.
Ar - Hmph, let's do something new now.
Ri - ...Huh?..
=ABG rilu_anal_6 rilu_anal_7=
Leaving dildo in Rilu's pussy, Arron pushed his cock into her butt.
Ri - Ah! 
Ri - Thats my ass!
Ar - Yep, how does it feel?
Ri - Aah... 
Ri - It feels weird...
Ri - Nh... Not entirely unpleasant.
Ar - Thought you might like it.
Ri - I can feel you throbbing.
Ar - Soon you'll feel much more than that.
Arron began moving inside of Rilu's butt.
Ri - Aaah... My ass...
Ar - Ngh...
Ar - How does it feel?
Ri - I... 
Ri - I-Ah... Think I'll start to like it...
Ar - Let's not forget about your pussy either.
While fucking Rilu's ass Arron also began to move the dildo he left in her pussy.
Ri - Ohhh-...
Ri - This...
Ri - This is too much...
Ri - You gonna make me..

Ar - Gotcha.

However, after a couple of rooms he lost a sight of her.

Ar - Maybe coming like that into an undead ruin wasn't a good idea after all.
Arron's thoughts were stopped by a loud noise from one of the halls.

Ar - Rilu? What's been going on here?
Ri - Arron.
Ri - You've been following me?
?(Z) - You should stop her... If you want to live.
Ar - Hmm? Who's this guy?
Ri - It's Zelroth. He used to be my student in the past.
Ar - I think I've heard this name in town. 
Ri - He used to be a gifted scientist and a doctor, but now he seems to prefer to raise the dead instead.
Ar - ...And that thing in your hand?
Ri - ........
Rilu demonstrates a small black ring. 
Ri - It's an ancient artifact - The Circle.

Ar - What?
Ri(cast) - Stay down.
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Invisible force has pushed Zelroth back onto the floor.
Z - Gh!..
Despite that he continued to talk.
Z - Long time ago an ancient race had this ring.
Z - It's the ultimate doomsday device.
Z - And it's capable of destroying our whole reality.
Ar(neutral) - That's a bit hard to imagine.
Z - Why don't you ask your "friend" then.
=SPRITE rilu=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
Ar(neutral) - ...Rilu?
Ri(talk) - I believe it to be true.
Ri - The world is in perpetual motion. 
Ri - People are born, live and die, their children are born to repeat the cycle. 
Ri - The sun rises only to set and then repeats this cycle indefinitely
Ri(talk) - That's the nature of existence, the one we are in, at least.
Ri(talk) - The Circle supposedly can stop it once and for all.
Ar(neutral) - You came here for this?
Ri - Yes. This was my goal all along. 
Ri - I was planning for it long before we met.
Ri - I have deceived you so I could find the ring.
Ar(neutral) - But why?
Ri - I can explain, but I don't expect you to understand it.
Ar(neutral) - No hurt in trying.
Ri - ...
Ri - I hate this world. 
Ri - And I hate this life.  
Ri(talk) - I have been evil all along.
Ri(talk) - And I want it to be destroyed. 
Ar(neutral) - But why would you kill yourself? 
Ri(talk) - *Sigh*
Ri - Because life to me is endless suffering.
Ri - I've told you before, my existence is nothing but agony.
Ri(talk) - I'm dead tired of being injured, tortured, left at the mercy of a mob or a toy for some maniac.
Ar(neutral) - I don't get it. Aren't you fine now? Don't you have fri-
Ri - I said, you won't understand it.
Ri - This is only a glimpse of peace in my eternity.
Ri - These never last long for me.
Ri(talk) - You can live and die, but I'll keep existing.
Ri - I'll be feared and hunted again in no time.
Ri - This is the cycle of my life, and I hate it. 
Ri - I hate people and nothing is better than ending it once for all.
Ar(neutral) - ...Is that really so? 
Ri(talk) - You won't stop me. 
Ar(neutral) - I don't believe you. 
Ri(talk) - Stop being stup-
Ar(neutral) - You are right. I can't understand how terrible your suffering was. 
Ar(neutral) - But I do understand that it's bad enough to make you wish to end the world.
Ar(neutral) - It must be why you show so few emotions too.
Ar(neutral) - Must really put off the bastards who tortured you for fun.
Ri - .......
Ar(neutral) - But you are also lying through your teeth.
Ar(neutral) - You aren't evil, and you absolutely don't hate people. You hardly used us either.
Ri - You are not making any sense.
Ar(neutral) - Despite all hardships you don't blame others.
Ar(neutral) - And you don't show any real grudge towards them.
Ar(neutral) - You care for me and you cared enough to save Iola, even though you hardly knew her.
Ar(neutral) - You pretend to be evil, because this way you hope to make me reject you.
Ar(neutral) - So you would have an easier time doing what you've planned
Ar - But I won't hate you. 
Ar - And I'm sure the other villagers and girls like you as well.
Ri(talk) - ...Shut up.
Ar(neutral) - What happened to you is unfortunate... No, terrible. 
Ar - But I can swear to you that nobody will abuse you as long as I live.
Ar - This might be not much for you, but this much I can guarantee. 
Ar - Don't you think that killing us all can wait for some time? 
Ar - I can't stop you after I'm dead anyway.
Ri - ...Y-You won't fool me.	
Ar(neutral) - You know I'm being serious. 
Ri - (What's this... Why am I trembling?)
Ar(neutral) - So, what do you say? 
Ar - The others might get worried if they find out we are missing. 
Ar - And it looks like something got in your eyes.

Rilu wiped her face with a sleeve.

I - I'm on the pilgrimage.
I - Actually, I was supposed to do it at a different time, but the Cult ruled for me to do it now.
I - I feel like it was father's initiative though. 
I(sad) - He acts differently since the time he returned.
Ar - What sort of pilgrimage?
I - I was requested to get Spirit Essence for the cult. 
I - So I thought maybe I could ask you to get it?
Ar - But isn't that supposed to be a task you have to complete personally? 
I - No, not really. Cult just uses initiates to gather it for future sellings.
I - Many do just buy it or hire someone to get it.
Ar - That's creative.
Ar - But what do you even need that for?
I - We make aphrodisiac out of it.
Ar - Hooh. An important industry for sure.
Ar(neutral) - It's fine if you are paying, but we might need some tips where to find it.
I(sad) - I'm sorry, I don't really know about that.

Ri - Don't worry, I'm used to it.

Ar - Rilu, Iola is looking for something called Spirit Essence.

Ro - Oh, that's a nice name.
Ri - According to the rumors it is brimming with stray undead.
Ro(sarcastic) -  Of course.
Ri - We are likely to find it there.
Ar - A full house of zombies. Should be fun.
Ro - Ugh...

Em - Oh? But what if I already have one?
Ro(sarcastic) - Let's not try it.
Ro - Please let's return, I don't feel very good around here.

Ar - That's the most convenient religion agitation I've ever heard.
I - So to become a proper Vestal I need to train at it.
I - So.. Um, we can start if you don't mind.
Ioal casually freed Arron's penis from his pants.
I - Oh... It's so big!
I - Sorry, it's going to be my first time...
I - We study a lot about human anatomy...
I - But touching it personally feels completely different...
I - Do I stroke it like this? 
=ABG iola_minet_1=
Iola begins to move her hand over Arron's dick.
Ar - Y-yes.
Ar - This would be correct.
I - Aha, this feels kinda intuitive. 
I - Do you like this?
Ar - Yes.
Ar - You can go a bit faster.
I - Alright...
=ABG iola_minet_2 iola_minet_3=
Iola increased her speed while trying to stay gentle.
I - Oh right.
I - I'm also supposed to use my mouth.
=ABG iola_minet_4 iola_minet_5=
Ar - Ouch, watch the teeth.
I - Oh, sorry.
I - I'll lick it.
I - Mmmhm...
I - It tastes weird.
I - ...Mmm...
I - How doesh ith heel?
Ar - For a first time I can't complain.
=ABG iola_minet_6 iola_minet_7=
I - (I'll try to do advanced thing)
I - *slurp*
I - (Wrapping my tongue around the tip)
Ar - Hah...
Ar - You put some real effort.
I - (He praised me)
I - Mmhm...
I - (I wonder if I'm blushing now)
Ar - Mh, Yes...
Ar - Just a bit more...
I - ....Mmhhm *slurp*
Ar - Watch it, I'm coming.
Iola nodded in confirmation.
=ABG iola_minet_8 iola_minet_9=
=WHITE=
Ar - Ugh...
I - ...!
A hot stream of semen struck Iola's throat. 
I - Mhm... *gulp*
I - Ah...
Pulling out the penis in the middle of ejaculation, a good part of it splashed over her face.
I - Sorry, I couldn't swallow it all.
Ar - Don't push yourself too hard.
Ar - I'll rate it 9 out of 10 for a first time.
I - Wow, that's a lot!
I - Thanks Arron.
Ar - It's been a pleasure.
I - I hope we can practice together more in future.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=

=SPRITE iola=
Ar - So, I was wondering one thing.
Ar - Are you supposed to do it for anyone who asks?
I - Well, actually there are options. 
I - Some Vestals do it for everyone, others only serve only selected persons or just their loved ones.
I - I haven't decided yet.
I - But there's no point until I finish my training.
I - And I still have to part with my virginity.
Ar - Oh, huh. 
Ar - Well, you know where to find me.

Ro - So, to sum it up, you are wasting too much money on fancy food.
Ar(neutral) - Rose, have you seen where we live at?
Ar - I'm not a peasant, I need fresh food. 
Ar - Tell her, Erika. 
Er - Well, I am used to the forests, so I will have to support Arron.
Ro(sarcastic) - Ugh... At least stop binging on the alcohol every second day...
=SOUND dooropen=
=SPRITE iola=
I - Hey, Arron, Rose, Erika.
I - Today is the Ancestor's Solidarity Day!
I - So... I wish to ask you to participate in the celebration.
Ro(talk) - Fine, as long as it doesn't cost us too much.
I - It costs nothing really. It's more of a spiritual practice.
I - You see, we are gonna need at least four people...
Ro - Eh...?
Ar - Oh, I haven't told you about her practices, right.
Ar - You see...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Er - Sounds fun. 
I - Right? What about you, Rose?
Ro(sarcastic) - No way. I absolutely refuse.
I(sad) - Oh... That's a bummer. 
Ar - Yeah, Rose, stop spoiling the fun.
Ro(sarcastic) - That's not fun, this is basically an orgy. 
I - Not exactly.
I - This will be centered around Arron, since he's our only man in charge. 
Ro(sarcastic) - I still refuse. 
Ro - (If they need at least four people, that means if I refuse, they won't do it anyway)
Er - Well, that's too bad. 
Er - Do you think Ember will be willing to take her place?
Ro(shocked) - Eh?!
I - Oh, we can ask her out.
Ro - (Wait)
Ro - (Master will be doing it with three other girls at same time)
Ro - (While I'll be left out)
Ro - ...
Ro(talk) - No, don't.
Ro - ...I'll do it.
Ar - Hmm? What's up Rose? I thought you're against it.
Ro - I... Don't... 
Ro - Uh... I can... 
Ro - I can try it for once, I suppose.
Ro - (Uh... why does nobody else around here have any problems with this?)
I - That's nice, I'll make sure everyone is comfortable and happy.
I - Give me half an hour or so.
I - Arron, get out. 
Ar - Gotcha.

Arron was waiting outside of the bedroom until he heard an invitation.
I - Okay, we are ready, you can come in!

A three girls laid naked before Arron spreading their legs in lewd poses.
Ar - Wow, now I know what I want for my birthdays.
I - Remember, this is an important ritual.
I - We satisfy our bodies and become closer.
Er - Look how timid Rose is.
Ro - I'm not timid! 
Ro - I'm just not used to such things...
Ar - You are doing good, Rose. 
Ar - I appreciate your dedication.
Ro - Shut up...
I - Arron, you can proceed however you like.
Er - Don't overexert yourself though.
Ar - Don't worry, I've been blessed with endless virility.
I - I've fed him with a stamina supplement, so it should be all good.
Ar - Jeez, why did you tell them. What about my image?
=ABG rose_erika_iola_2 rose_erika_iola_3=
Er - Oo-oh... 
Er - I'm getting it first.
Ar - You are always ready, aren't you.
Er - Ah... yes...
Er - Screw me rougher... 
Er - Like this...
Er - You stirring my pussy... 
Er - With your big dick...
Erika kept enticing Arron while moving her body in response.
I - I could learn a few things from Erika.
I - Rose, I see you are getting excited too. 
I - You can touch yourself too.
I - Or do you want me to help you out?
Ro - N-no, this is fine...
Ro - Ah!
=ABG rose_erika_iola_4=
Unexpectedly Arron picked up their conversation and moved his hand to Rose's crotch.
Ar - Don't be so uptight, here's your beloved master's caress.
Ro - That's... 
Ro - Ah... Good...
I - Wow, nice multitasking. 
I - You are really skilled, Arron.
Ar - I'm getting close...
Er - Great, my pussy is too...
Er - Harder... 
Er - Push as deep... 
Er - As you can...
Ar - Nghh!..
Er - AAAhhh!..
=ABG rose_erika_iola_5 rose_erika_iola_6=

Er - It's filling me.
Er - Your hot spunk...

Ar - Phew... Two more to go.

I - Aah...
I - It's inside.
I - Ah... 
I - You are reaching so deep.
I - I... Ah...
I - Haven't practiced enough.
Ar - Mh, your pussy is as tight as the first time.
I - T-thank you.
Ro - Oh...
Er - Hehe, it seems Rose feels lonely.
Er - And you are all dripping down there too.
Ro - Stop...
Er - Don't be sad, I bet he left the best for the dessert. 
=ABG rose_erika_iola_9=
Meanwhile Iola and Arron focused solely on their intercourse.
I - I'm sorry, I feel like..
I - I'm...
I - Ah, I'm getting close...
Ar - Me too...
I - Aahh... Ahh.
I - I'm cumming!...
=ABG rose_erika_iola_10 rose_erika_iola_11=
Arron pumped Iola's pussy with his hot seed.
I - AAaah...
Ar - OOoh...
Ar - Ha-h... This is pretty intense.
I - This felt amazing.
Ar - Likewise. 
Pulling out of Iola, Arron finally moved to the girl who had been left waiting this whole time.
Ar - You must be bouncing off the walls, Rose. 
Ro - ...Just do it already.
Ar - Come on, don't be so distant.
Ar - You'd be spoiling the fun for others.
Ro - ...Sorry, please make l-love to me.
Er - Aww, how old-fashioned.
Ar - Alright, here's your patience reward...
=ABG rose_erika_iola_12 rose_erika_iola_13=
Arron carefully pushed his cock inside of the already wet Rose.
Ro - Ah... 
RO - Master...
Ar - Wow, don't remember you ever being this soaked.
Ar - You've been fighting back so much, but this seems to really excite you.
Ro - It's not like that... 
Ro - Ah...
Ar - Don't you enjoy it?
Ro - Yes... 
Ro - Faster...
Ar - Just look at this.
Ar - We are turning our meek Rose into a passionate whore.
=ABG rose_erika_iola_14=
Ro - Stop... Ah... 
Er - Seeing her expression makes me jealous. 
I - She looks like she's completely into it.
Er - Well it's often more exciting when you aren't prepared for it.
Ro - Ah... Master... 
Ro - I love you...
Ro - And your cock...
Ar - Damn you Rose.
Ar - Enjoying this more than even me.
Ro - I'm almost... 
Ro - I'm cumming!!

Ro - AAaah!....
Ro - Ah... Hah... Ahh... 
I - You did great, Rose!
Er - Hehe, looking at you, made me wish to go for a second round.
Ro - Eh?... We aren't done?
Ar - Why would we be? Today we feast.
Ro - Uh...
I - That's true. We can continue for at least until evening.
Er - He-he, let me get on top of Rose this time.

Em - Sir Arron! 
Em - Look what I've found this morning near my bed.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm? A note? 
Ro - Let me see it... 
Ro - "You must go the Dragon Mountains"?
Ar - That's some atrocious writing. 
Ar - Have you written it, Ember?
Em - No, I can't write. 
Ar - Huh... What are those Dragon Mountains anyway?
Ro(sarcastic) - I wonder.
Er - Its large mountains in the North of Aeros. 
Er - People aren't very common around there, except as a meal.
Em(tired) - I feel like this is important. 
Em - Can we go there?
Ar - If I say "No", are you going to do it anyway?
Em - Yes!
Ro(talk) - That doesn't seem like a very good idea.
Ar - Welp, looks like we don't have a choice. 
Ar - Ember is an important member of our community.
Ar - And I can't be left without a blacksmith. 
Ar - Suddenly it feels like I'm being blackmailed.
Em - Hmm, what's blackmailed? 
Ar - You can tell her, Rose.
Ro(sarcastic) - What do you mean by that?
Ar - Pretty sure that's what you've often been doing back at home.
Ro(sarcastic) - That wasn't a blackmail. It was mutually beneficial coercion. 
Ar - ....On other hand, maybe I shouldn't let you teach Ember.

Ar - Oh, I've tasted her already, alright.

=SPRITE dragon=
Dr - Foolish mortals! How dare you approach me?
Ro(talk) - Wow, this one can speak!
Ar(neutral) - Damnit... Now we can't eat them.
Em - Why?
Ar(neutral) - It's obvious, you can't eat sentient things. 
Em - ...Really?
Ro - Stop it. Look, we came here because our friend-
Dr - For this offence you'll have to pay!
Er - I feel like he might not be listening... 
Ri - He looks quite old.
Ar - Darn, I guess there's no choice but to fight.
=STOP=

**Mountain Dragon Talk**
=SPRITE dragon=
The large dragon is held in place breathing heavily.
Dr - Guh... Enough...
Dr - You've proven your strength. What do you want?
Ro - As we said-
Dr - What?
Dr - Speak Louder! 
Em - WE HAVE COME BECAUSE OF ME!
Dr - Hmm? What's this...
The huge dragon brought his head closer to the ground and observed Ember.
Dr - Ooh, why haven't you said so sooner. 
Ar - Because of your senile deafness.
Dr - Quiet. You'll be worse than me in mere decades.
Ar - ...So now you can hear.
Dr - You have a familiar scent.
Dr - What's your name, child?
Em - I'm Ember. Nice to meet you.
Em - Even though we've fought already. 
Dr - I see... You are the child of Ezet. 
Dr - Truly a wonder to meet someone like you. 
Em - Ezet? Is that the name of my mother?
Dr - Yes. You have no knowledge of your ancestry? A pity.
Dr - Ezet was one of our wyer. But it's from a time before we were facing today's crisis. 
Ro - What crisis? 
Dr - Hmm... I'll need time to explain.
Dr - We dragons possess souls unlike normal mortals. Andh these souls grant us sentience. 
Dr - When a dragon dies, his soul leaves his body and finds its way to a new one.
Dr - Without a soul, we are but beasts. You've met many of those on your way here. 
Dr - From some time ago something has changed. 
Dr - Dead dragons have been reborn less and less. Somehow, their souls can't find a way back here.
Em(tired) - No way.
Dr - I haven't seen anyone here for the last few years. I fear that we might be hunted. 
Dr - But it feels like... You might have Ezet's soul inside of you.
Dr - Somehow she managed to conceal herself inside of you.
Em - My mother inside of me? So I'm her?
Dr - No. It would be more accurate to say that she lays dormant, perhaps occasionally influencing your actions. 
Ro(talk) - Then that note was likely her doing.
Em - So that means... My mother is dead? 
Dr - Yes and no, her body is likely dead, but her soul is within you for now. 
Dr - I hope she will eventually be reborn as we once were.
Dr - Although I did not expect her to take a... Mortal partner. 
Dr - At times like these I will not complain. 
Dr - My name is Qothus.
Dr - I welcome you as one of my kin. 
Ar - Before you continue with the family reunion, there's one thing we need to ask for.
Dr - Yes?
Ro - We are currently looking for someone...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Dr - Curious story, but my knowledge is not enough to help you here. 
Dr - I don't know anything about that person or item you possess.
Ar - Well damn. At least I've defeated a dragon today. What do you think father would say?
Ro - Now that you say it, we actually did...
Ar - Well, Ember, take your time, we will be waiting around the corner.
Party leaves Ember alone with the Qothus.
Em - I didn't expect this would turn out like this.
Dr - Threads of destiny are often chaotic in nature.
Dr - Your mate is strong, you've chosen wisely.
Em - Wha-? Sir Arron is not my...
Dr - Or was it Ezet's influence, I wonder.
Em - Um, could you tell me about my mother?
Dr - Oh, she was one nasty rascal.
Dr - And a fool unlike others. 
Dr - Always got into fights with others. One time she even scorched Elder's nest cave.
Dr - ...
Dr - Shame I won't see her again.
Em - You were related?
Dr - We are all siblings in a sense.
Em - Ah, so I can call you an Uncle Qothus then?
Dr - This is...
Em - Please?
Dr - *sigh* Alright.
Em - But what should I do now?
Dr - You look quite accustomed to mortals. 
Dr - You should naturally stay with them now.
Dr - In truth, I don't know if we will even continue to exist for much longer.
Dr - I haven't seen or heard of anyone for a long time until you came.
Dr - So go, glide proudly and remember what you are. 
Dr - Don't shy away from returning here if you need help. 
Dr - I may look old, but a few more centuries are nothing for me.
Em - Thanks, Uncle Qothus I'm glad we met.
Ember awkwardly hugged the big dragon.

D - Maybe time to do some real jobs then?
V - Hey, you've given me the pass on this hunt.
D - Because dragons were dangerous to us.
D - You've driven them to extinction by this point.
V - I'm not doing it for fun, once I get all of their powers, we won't need to chase that fool.
D - Hmph, that's just your assumptions.
D - And you are out of luck now.
D - .....
D - Actually, I might have a lead for you.
V - You aren't trying to make me your dirty work, do you?
D - You make it sound like I'm some sort of scheming bastard. 
D - You must remember the wretch, Arron? The one who I told you to keep your eyes on?

Ro - It says "I know you are hiding a dragon offspring. Give her away or your little village will be demolished."
Ro - "This is the only warning. Bring it to the Aeros' Forest entrance."
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, I guess we have a new task on our hands.
Ro - They make a threat against the village, and this looks like a trap.
Ro - Why would they need Ember? 
Ar(shock) - I don't care. My harem is mine and if they dare to threaten it, I won't give them any mercy.
Ro(sarcastic) - You really should stop seeing us as your property.

V - But now you all will die. 
V - Dimitrius will be happy I had to do his dirty work.
Em - Why? What do you want from me?
V - Nothing, you just seem to have something I need.
V - Damn you look weak.
Em - Eh? I don't understand. 
V - You don't? Haven't you been visiting the dragon lately?
Em - Uncle Qothus?..
V - That's its name? 
V - Sorry, I don't take note how my prey was called. 
Em - What?..
Em - You have...
V - Yes, I slayed it. 
Em(sad) - ...
Em(sad) - Why?
V - *Sigh* Why do men hunt? 
V - To dominate. To feed. To feel joy.
V - And also to test himself. 
Em - You killed Uncle Qothus!
Ro - Calm down, Ember!
V - Yeah, save yourself some energy for the fight.
Ar - So you test yourself by challenging some girl who looks weak and killing time-worn dragons?
V - Hmph. You have a sharp tongue boy.
V - But you are right, it's not much of a test.
Ar(neutral) - So what's your deal?
V - Do you know about dragon souls? 
Ar(neutral) - More or less.
V - I've been collecting them for long years. It seems one was hiding by your side.
Ar(neutral) - And I presume you'd get something by getting them all. 
V - Strength. Immortality. Power. You name it. 
V - A reward worthy of a supreme warrior.
V - And it all lies within my grasp now. 
V - The only reason I'm telling you about this is  your death looms. 
Ar(angry) - I'm sick of this psycho. He deserves some retribution.

As Victor's skull cracked, the blade fell from his hand.

Being close to the streams, a shining essence has been drawn from Ember's hands.

Em - You were with me all this time. 
Em - And you gave birth to me.
DrM - You've grown well.
Em - Thank you.
Em - What happens now?
DrM - You have freed their souls.
DrM - Now they can be reborn into a new hatchling. 
Em - So, we saved them?
DrM - Yes, you've done a great deed.
DrM - But it seems I'll have to go too. 
Em - ...
Em - Thanks for staying with me all this time. 
DrM - Heh, I was sure you'd be crying here.
Em - Maybe we can meet again?
DrM - After rebirth we will not remember who we were in previous life.
DrM - But I'm glad you have found your place and friends you can rely on. 
DrM - Arron. You are still to face great dangers, but I trust you to take care of my daughter. 
Ar - Hmm... I'm not sure I'm up to the responsibility yet. 
DrM - Don't worry, I'm  sure you can make Ember some fine offspring with some practice.
Em - Eh?!
DrM - After all I've almost had first-hand experience.
Ar - You had what?!
DrM - Don't act so surprised now. My daughter is too innocent to take initiative, so I gave her a couple of hints.
Ar - ...And took some liberty in the bedroom...?
DrM - That was the best for all of us. 
DrM - But it's time for me to go. 
DrM - Good luck, children. 
With last words vanishing in the air so did the image of Ezet.

Ro - And he might know how we can get back.

I - Alright, this must be the place.
Ar - Great. What do we do now?
I - I'll prepare the ritual. You can just wait.
Ar(neutral) - Damn, I hate waiting. 
Ri - I'll help.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
I - Alright, now...
As Iola chanted the spell, ruins began glowing with blue light. After a couple of seconds a figure appeared in front of them.
T - Wretches! What the fuck do you want?
Ar(neutral) - ......
Ro(shock) - ......
I(shock) - .....
T - ...Sorry, Let's try this again. 
T - Hi. Who are you?
Ar - None of your fuckin' business.
Ro(shock) - Master!
Ar - What? Maybe it's his way of saying 'hi'.
Ar - Is this even the correct guy?
Ri - *Nod*
I - I can't believe my eyes, you really are a Saint Sergius from holy texts!
T - ...You can call me that, if you must.
I - I never thought I would meet someone like you.
T - Hmmh? Well that was some time ago...
Ar - I respect your religious insight, but we kinda have some business here. 
I - Oh, I'm sorry. Let me explain...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
I(sad) - So I was hoping you could help me to figure out what's going on with my father and the cult...
T - Did you say that the cult is searching for demons invading this world?
I - Yes. 
T - No, this is wrong. 
I(shock) - Eh?
T - Demons do not invade this world in physical form. 
T - They can't leave their dimension at will and enter here.
T - What they do instead is influence and corrupt other beings. In some cases to an extreme degree.
T - Like local dwarves who turned into bloodthirsty maniacs, or faeries being massive bitches.
Ar(neutral) - That explains quite a lot. 
I(sad) - I had no idea. What are demons really then?
T - They are entities from another dimension, who generally seek a life energy which they feed on. 
T - Violence, negative emotions, things like this. They would gladly enter this world but most aren't powerful enough for that. 
T - Once defeated they return to their realm, but strong light power can kill them entirely.
T - From the sound of it, I'd guess your father isn't quite himself anymore. 
T - But spare me from these worldly worries. Is there something else? 
Ar - Actually yes, I wanna know who you really are.
T - You don't take me for a God? 
Ar - Hardly.
T - Haha, well, let's say I'm sort of a traveller like you, except that I came here willingly. 
Ar - Is that so?
T - Well... I willingly escaped my pursuers a long time ago and chose this world. 
Ar - So you are basically a fugitive. Got it.
T - Shhh, don't tell anyone.
Ro - You can move through dimensions on will?
T - Yes, kind of, it's the power I possess. Envious? You can't have it.
Ro(talk) - No, but we could use your help to go home.
T - Hah. Hahahah. 
Ro - Could you please do that? 
T - Hmh... I could. For this you'd have to bring me something first.
T - There are four elements. Earth, Water, Fire and Air.
Ar - .....
T - Their existence is focused in certain places, deep underground, vast oceans, skies and so on.

I(shock) - NOOO!
D - Sorry to interrupt your party, but I kinda needed his powers.
D - And now I finally have them. Must thank you for finding him for me, haha. 
Ar(angry) - You'll pay for this.
Arron charged at Dimitrius from a few feet away.
But as his sword was about to strike, Dimitrius disappeared and quickly reappeared on the other side of the cave.
D - Watch out, it's dangerous to run with sharp things.
Ar(angry) - What the hell...
D - Hahaha, aren't these powers great?
D - Okay, have fun worms, daughter...
I(shock) - .....
D - There's things that need to be set in motion.

Dimitrius teleported out of the cave leaving everyone in shock.
=SPRITE iola=
I(shock) - Please, don't die, I... can heal you...
T - You can't... 
T - I've been running away long enough...
T - This will... Get very bad...
T - Listen... You must stop him...
T - The cult... is his tool...
The last words of Sergius escaped his mouth as life left his body.
I(shock) - No, this can't be!
Ar - .....We must go.
Ar - Iola?
I(sad) - .......
After a few minutes they left the caves.

I(sad) - Sorry, I need some rest.
Ro - Sure, let me help you.

Em(tired) - I don't get it. Why is she so upset?
Ri - Her father just killed the saint in front of her eyes. 
Ri - She might not have truly known him, but it's too much to take for her beliefs. 
Ar(neutral) - I haven't actually considered that.
Em(tired) - Sorry, I still don't understand. 
Ri - It's fine, we might have worse things to deal with soon.

F - Hey, big guy, there's some nasty news coming from Aeros.
Ar - Really? What about?
F - Dunno, something like a war?
F -  There seem to be many refugees coming from that direction.
F - Just thought you'd be interested to know about it.
Ar(neutral) - Doesn't seem good. I guess we should check it out.

The team has entered Aeros observing the surrounding disaster.
Ro(Sad) - This looks horrible...
Surv - What are you doing here?!
Surv - You should escape with everyone now!
Ar(neutral) - What exactly is going on?
Surv - Monsters and demons attacked the city.
Surv - They have taken the city hall and now hunt every man in the vicinity.
Surv - Some guards still try to fight, but it's all meaningless.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm.. What about the city hall?
Surv - People say everyone there was killed. Monsters come from there as if there's a nest.
Ar - I guess that's our target then.
Surv - Whatever, if you die it's not my problem.
Ar(neutral) - Why don't you show some guts? It's your city after all.
Surv - You are a fool.
Surv - At times like these your only chance to survive is to watch out for yourself.

The team has barged into the main city hall as Annet meets them there.
An - Look what we have here.
An - Can't say I expected to see you still alive.
Ar(neutral) - I knew you were a one kind of a bitch after learning your history with Erika.
Ar(neutral) - But must say, this is a whole different level. 
An - I'm glad you appreciate my work.
Ro(shock) - Your work? 
Ro(shock) - You are slaughtering innocent people!
An - People, cattle, who cares.
An - I'm glad we are finally past the acting stage and I don't have to deal with their stupidity.
An - Won't deny it, I did have my fun a couple of times though.
An - But it was taking too much time.
Ar(neutral) - Whatever, let's just beat the shit out of her.
An - Tsk, you are throwing away the few minutes of life I am gifting you.
An - And with such bad manners too.
An - I'll take care of your friends, once you die, Arron.

A horde of large demons swarmed the hall from all directions.

Ar(shock) - Stay together.
Ro - There's too many
Em - Ngh...
An - How does it feel to be outnumbered now?
An - Ha-h, lets see how long you'll hold up.
An - But while we are at it...
I(sad) - This looks really bad, there's no end to them.
An - *Chanting*
An - Erika, return to my side!
Er(sad) - .....
Ro(talk) - Eh... Erika?
Ar(shock) - Where are you going?
Er(sad) - I'm... sorry.
Ignoring the battle and enemies, Erika left the team and slowly walked into Annet's direction.
Ro(shock) - No way...
An - Hahah, you imbeciles!
An - Did you seriously think I'd leave my toy with no security measures?
Ro - You are the lowest.
Ro(talk) - Stop, Erika!
An - Don't waste your breath.
An - She was hypnotized long time ago to obey my will on command. 
Ri - We won't hold without her...
An - You know how to secure victory?
An - Never leave things to chance, a backup plan is mandatory.
An - Isn't that nice, Eri...?
=switch to cg1=
Whole room froze in awe as Erika stabbed Annet's neck.
An - Wha...t...
An - Why...
Er - You are right.
Er - Never leave things to chance.
Er - You really thought I would never learn about your hypnosis and find out how to resist it? 
An - You... biiitch!.. 
Er - I've learned from the best.
An - Ghhh!..

Er - Phew... 
Er - I'm shaking now.
Er - But somehow feel great.
Ar - Yeah, you've saved us.
Er - Turns out, I'm a pretty good actress, huh?
Ro - You really made us worried.

Er - So I thought this would be a safer approach.

Ar(anger) - Dimitrius!
D - Now, don't look so mad.
D - You've done me a great service today and I'll spare your lives for some time.
Ar(neutral) - You talk highly for someone who'll be gutted by the end of this.
D - Ahahah, nice one, Arron. 
D - You actually have no idea how troublesome it is to kill another demon lord with a big reputation in this world. 
D - But you actually did it.
Ro - You wanted her dead? That's why you didn't help her?
D - That's what I said. 
D - I actually thought about giving you a hand on one occasion, but you managed anyway.
Ri - You've left your kin here to die like that.
Ro - They don't think of their own any higher than of normal people.
Em - You really aren't afraid to lose?
D - What, do you really  think I should be worried about you?
D - You just don't understand, do you?
D - You are not a threat. You killed Annet, but she was weak and stupid. 
D - I can squash you all like bugs, but you never know when you might need a couple of resourceful mortals.
I - We'll stop you and end this madness.
D - Yeah, sure, struggle some more if you wish.
D - Have your little celebration, for today.

Ar(neutral) - ....He's gone.
Ri - There seems to be a crowd outside.
Ro - Those are probably the survivors.

Surv - It was you? You defeated the demons?
Ar - No, we just were really persuasive.
Surv - Eh? 
Ar - Let's return to the village. 
Ro - Agreed, this was a tough day.
Surv - But what should we do? What if demons return?
Ar - I'm afraid my charisma is too low to take you all.
Ar - You will have to figure out how to defend yourself eventually.
The team left puzzled civilians.
I(sad) - I wonder if we should've left them like this.
Ar(neutral) - It can't be helped.
Er - After seeing what was happening in the city I don't feel like we should've helped them even if we could.

Ar(neutral) - We have enough to deal with on our hands already.
Ro - What are we gonna do about Dimitrius though?
Ar(neutral) - Maybe we won't do anything. 
Ar(neutral) - He seems to be quite dangerous, but isn't really hostile.
Ro(talk) - What do you mean?
Ro(talk) - Now since he got those powers we won't be able to go back too.
Ar(neutral) - Rose, why do you think I want to go back? 
Ar - To live the rest of my life in the shadow of my brother, who attempted to get rid of me?
Ar - Not to mention being chained to the palace and deal with all the dumb people there. 
Ro - But it was our home. 
Ar(neutral) - Yes, except nobody is waiting for us there. 
Ar(neutral) - I've never had the freedom to do anything useful in my life until we ended up here.
Ro - But... What should I do?
Ar(neutral) - You aren't my slave anymore. 
Ar - You can choose what to do with your own life as well. 
Ro(talk) - But I don't-

Rose found herself in an enclosed room in a place she hasn't seen before.
The small room only had two other people besides her: Iola and Dimitrius.
Ro - Iola? Why..?
Iola acted as she couldn't hear or see Rose. 
Ro(talk) - What have you done to her!?
D - Why are you mortals so dense? 
D - Who do you think she is? 
Ro - Our friend. 
D - Then you should choose better friends.
D - She's a member of the cult, you idiot. 
D - The cult, which was reestablished solely to help us invade this world.
D - She was trained since her birth to succumb to our control and serve us however she might. 
D - Naturally I've planted a few additional suggestions when she was imprisoned, just in case it could prove to be useful.
Ro - This is disgusting. 
D - Thanks. But I didn't ask your opinion on that.
Ro - What do you want of me?
D - I have a proposal for you.
Ro(sarcastic) - ...What?
D - To put it briefly, I offer you to take the place of Annet. 
D - After her death there's some gap in ranks. 
D - You could fit right in and have the same powers she had.
D - In return you'll only have to pledge your loyalty to me.
D - Given that it will save you from the eventual demise of your kind, I see it as an extremely nice offer. 
Ro - ......
D - You will have some time to think about it. 
D - Take her to the jail cell.

Ri - Rather, help me out.
Ar(neutral) - How? You have a plan?
Ri - Yes, but we will need to visit the Summerhill Keep first.

Ar - We all sometimes feel like we hate everything and everyone, especially about someone close.
Ar - You remember how you supported Ember when we met for the first time?
Ro - ...
Ar - And how you volunteered to save Erika, when she was captured, despite the danger?
Ro(sarcastic) - That was...
Ar - And how you yelled at me right before we ended up here. 
Ro(sad) - *sob* M-master...
Ro(sad) - I'm so sorry... Waaah...
Ar - Ouch, easy there...
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
...
Ar - Feeling better now?
Ro - *nod*
Ar - Jeez... I feel like I'm doing a therapist’s job a lot lately.
Ro(talk) - I haven't thought about you being compassionate before.
Ar - Tell anyone and I'll kill you. 
Ro - I have to ask forgiveness from the others. 
Ar - Yeah, you can do that.
Ro - Thank you, Master. 
Ro - I'll be off now. Get well soon.

Ar - On a second thought... A liaison might not be a bad idea.
Ar(neutral) - Rose, wait, you hear me?
Ar - Darn it.

Z - So you've come again. 
Ar - Why don't you give us what we need and we pretend we've never met.
Z - Don't expect to take me by surprise with such cowardly tricks like last time. 
Ri(talk) - You've been kidnapping people and turning them into undead to fight for you and you call me a coward?
Z - Hah, those are just natural resources. 
Z - What is their purpose if not serving us?
Ri - We are wasting time talking to him.
Z - Once your friends join my army, I'll have plenty of use for you in my experiments.

F - Hey, looks like you've made it.
F - I wanted to see you, but your gals didn't let me in. 
Ar - Fair, they didn't let me out either.
Ar - So what's been going on?
F - Not much, except for bloodthirsty monsters and demons roaming around.
F - Good thing they don't seem to care much about our village though.
F - And that huge dead town thing emerging on the east where you've come from last time.
F - Kinda feels like the world is coming to an end.
Ar - True... I should check this out before it's too late.

**Future city entrance**
=BG future_city=
Ro - This place looks so bizzare. 
Ro - Everything is made out of stone, but it’s crumbling.
Ri(talk) - Looks like it was a human city before it was brought here. 
Er - I could never imagine a city like that.
Ri - Probably built with some advanced magic or technologies.
Ar - I'd be more worried about what we're gonna meet here. 
Ar(neutral) - Wouldn't like to repeat my last encounter. 
I - Yes, let's move with caution.

D - How do you like my work? 
Ro(talk) - This is terrible. Why would you do this?
D - Don't be so boring.
D - When else would you be able to see something so different to your insipid lives?
Ar(neutral) - Pardon my insipidness, but we're going to stop you.
D - Hahaha, that's a funny joke. 
D - You fight for this world, but it's a lost cause.
D - I really like your persistence, but look at yourself.
D - You guys are the only ones who actually came. 
Ar(neutral) - But it was you, who made locals indifferent to their future. 
D - Bullshit. It's just your nature. 
D - To be cattle for us. 
Ar(anger) - Getting really sick of your arrogance.
D - Great, entertain me little moths!

D - Hmph, enough of this little play.
Ar - Getting cold feet now? 
D - Don't make me laugh-
Without hesitation Arron charged at Dimitrius
=SPRITE_HIDE=
But he teleported at the last moment a few feet into the air.
Ar(neutral) - Tsk.
D - Let me show something really cool.
Ro - Huh? 
A sound of distant explosions shook the air.
As they turned the way it came from, they could see a small object flying through the air.
Er - Look!
Ar(Shock) - Shit, dodge!
Before Arron noticed, Dimitrius had escaped, observing them from a safe distance.
=SPRITE demitrius=
=SOUND explosion=
An explosion of insane power erupted on top of the square where he just fought.
D - Hahaha! 
D - These toys are really something.
D - How did you like this tactical nuke, Arron?
D - Ah, I guess you can't answer anymore.

Ar - Shit... Everyone alright?
Ro(talk) - Yes, we've got pushed underground by the blast.
Ro - Iola shielded us in the last moment.
I(sad) - Sorry, I...
=Fall sound=
Ar(shock) - Iola?
Ri(talk) - She's fine, just exhausted.
Ar(neutral) - Alright, we need some time to rest.
Em(sad) - But what should we do now? 
Em(sad) - We can't beat him like this.
Ar(neutral) - Well, he must think we are dead.
Ar(neutral) - Means we have some time to think about it.
...
...
Er - Hey, I found the exit to the sewers.
Ar - Phew, at least we aren't buried alive. Let's go.
=STOP=

**finish sewers sequence**
=city sewers underground bg, rose sprite =
Ro - I see an exit.
Ar - Finally. Let's see what's there.
...
...
The group entered a small building filled with books and unknown devices.
=caliban sprite=
Ro(shock) - Ah!
C - Ah. 
Ar(shock) - It's Zelroth's minion!
C - Oh, it's you guys.
Ri - He looks somewhat different.
Ar(neutral) - You are not going to fight us?
C - No, I'd rather not.
Ar - You also talk differently.
Ar - Where's Zelroth then?
C - He's no more. I've absorbed his intelligence. 
C - Must thank you for that opportunity. 
Ro(talk) - But what are you doing here then? 
C - Studying. I've been having an unusual thirst for knowledge recently. 
C - Humans here had a really advanced understanding of the world and nature.
Ar(neutral) - Well, if you aren't going to fight we should move on.
C - ....Hold on. 
C - Are you still planning to fight Dimitrius?
Ar - Do we look like we have any other option?
C - You hardly have any chances on your own at his current power.
Ar - So what, do you suggest we  give up?
C - No, I actually want to offer you some help.
Ro - Why? How do we even trust you?
C - I'm not one of them and it's only a matter of time after they finish you off that they get to me.
C - And they are not going to like what I did.
C - Between you and the demons I'd clearly prefer your dominance.
Ar(neutral) - Fair enough, I don't mind letting you go free.
Ar(neutral) - As long as you aren't going to repeat Zelroth's deeds. Caliban, was it?
C - No, actually I've chosen a new name for me. Now I'm Cyrex.
Ar - Alright, Cyrex, so what can you offer.
C - I'm not going to help you personally, but there still might be a way to defeat Dimitrius.
C - Although, it's not going to be simple at all.
Ar - Something is better than nothing.
C - Good. Then, you must be aware that demons are weak to light.
=Black screen transition=
The team has made preparations and moved to their new destination while Dimitrius still had no idea where they are.

**final fight**
=future city building bg, Dimitrius sprite=
D - So this is where you've been hiding. 
Ar(neutral) - Shit, he found us.
D - You really are tenacious to survive that. Just like little cockroaches. 
D - But it's time to finish our little game. 
Ar(anger) - For once I agree with you. 
Ar(anger) - Let's do this.

**dimitrius final fight win**
=Future building bg, dimitrius sprite=
D - Ghah, you idiots. 
D - Still don't understand that you can't defeat me.
Ar(shocked) - Damnit. You guys escape, I'll hold him back.
D(anger) - ...Seriously?
D - Fine, I'll play with you for the last time, Arron.
*snap*
A number of demon minions jumped from the outside into the building. 
Ar(anger) - Gh...
D - Go after them!
D - Now I made you look like an idiot. Ahaha!
Ar(neutral) - We'll see about that, asshole.
Saying that, Arron turned his back and ran away.
D(anger) - ...?
D - This imbecile never learns. 
=Footstep sound=
=Black screen transition=
Meanwhile Rose and Erika moved through the lab’s upper floors.
Ro - Come on, come on.
Ro(talk) - Erika, you sure you remember the map?
Er - Of course, elves have an excellent photographic memory. 
Er - Or so I was told anyway.
Ro(talk) - Please, we are in a dire situation here. 
Er - I'm kidding, it should be around this corner. 
=Demon sprite=
Demon - Arrgh!
Ro(shock) - Oh no, they found us!
Er(sad) - I guess we will have to fight through them.

**finish rose-erika-demons-fight**
=future building bg rose sprite=
Ro - We made it...
Er - Yes, come in, it's after this door.
Ro(talk) - Great.
Rose and Erika entered the room filled with glowing glass screens.
Er - Alright, it's your turn.
Ro - Uh... This might take some time.
Er - You sure you can manage it?
Ro(sarcasm) - No, it would help if you could help me out too.
Er - You know I'm too stupid for this stuff.
Ro - ...Just let Rilu know we got there. 
=black screen transition=
Meanwhile Arron kept escaping from Dimitrius.
After making through another room he ended up in a small room connected to a giant curved structure.
Without taking a pause he opened a small hatch and jumped inside, sealing it shut behind him.
=Black screen transition, tunnel bg=
=dimitrius sprite=
Right as he finished, Dimitrius predictably appeared next to him. 
=Slash sound=
Arron attempted to land a surprise attack, but Dimitrius blocked it.
Ar(anger) - Damn you.
D - It seems your brilliance is finally overshadowed by your human nature.
D - What a stupid thing to trap yourself in this place even though I can easily  teleport.
Dimitrius was correct, they appeared to be inside of an isolated curving tunnel only spacious enough to allow one person running in it.
Ar(anger) - ...
=black screeen transition=
=future building bg, rilu sprite=
Meanwhile Ember, Rilu and Iola ran from the other side of the tunnel. 
Ri - Ember, give it to me.
Em - Sure.
Ember passed Rilu a small piece of red cloth that she managed to rip off Dimitrius' outfit during the fight.
Ri - Erika said they got to the control room as well.
Ri - Iola, you can start making your preparations.
I - Got it!
=Demon sprite=
Demon - Arghh!
Em - Oh no, they found us!
Ri - We have no time for this. 
=start rilu-ember-iola-demons fight=
=STOP=

**finish rilu-ember-iola-demons fight**
Em - Looks like it was the last of them.
Ri - Good, now time to start the preparations.
I - Understood. How's Arron doing?
Ri - He's struggling, we should hurry.
Em - What should I do?
Ri - Stay on guard.
Em - Okay!
=Black screen transition=
=tunnel bg, dimitrius sprite=
D - Exhausted from running in circles? 
D - Too bad you are only a weak human.
=Slash sound=
Arron threw another strike but Dimitirus blocked it.
Ar(anger) - Gh, you are really starting  to get on my nerves.
D - Ahaha, great, let's fool around for the last time!
=start arron-dimitirus combat=
=STOP=

=arron-dimitrius combat win=
=tunnel bg, dimitrius sprite=
=Sword fall sound=
After a few clashes Dimitrius has managed to strike Arron's sword from his hands.
Ar(shock) - Ah!
D - And it's over.
Ar(anger) - Like hell it is!
Taken by surprise, Dimitrius was attacked by barehanded Arron, throwing him on the ground.
=tumble sound=
What he didn't see is how Arron pulled the shock baton out of his clothes.
D(anger) - What the-
=shocker sound=
Bzzzzt
D(anger) - Arrggh... You bastard...
As the baton was connected to Dimitrius body, electrical shock ran through his body completely immobilizing and depowering him to the point he couldn't speak easily.
Ar - Hah, so it does work on you after all. 
D(anger) - You... Will pay for this...
Arron kept Dimitrius in one spot as electrical current continued to restrict him.
Ar(neutral) - You know what really gets on my nerves? 
D(anger) - You are... just postponing the inevitable...
Ar(neutral) - It's your trash attitude towards us. 
D(anger) - You still... can't kill me...
Ar(neutral) - Humans aren't the animals you take us for.
D(anger) - And once energy... runs out...
Ar(neutral) - I actually believe we can achieve great things.
D(anger) - You will... fucking die...
Ar(neutral) - You aren't even listening. 
Ar - Well, at least you won't tell it to others.
=black screen transition=
=future city building, rose sprite=
Meanwhile Rose has finally grasped the controls of the reactor. 
Ro(talk) - Alright, I'm starting it.
Er - Roger, I'll let Rilu know.
Ro - Master, please be safe.
=black screen transition, Rilu sprite=
Ri - ...It's starting.
Ri(talk) - Iola, wait for my signal.
I - O-okay!
Rilu began to chant the spell, as lights around the structure began to work.
=Black screen transition, tunnel bg, dimitrius sprite=
As Arron kept Dimitrius disabled, he sensed how the mechanisms around him went into motion and small lights turned on.
Ar(neutral) - It seems I don't have much time left. 
D - ...Hah... starting to regret... your arrogance?
Ar(neutral) - I've heard that demons hate light. 
D(anger) - (Keep talking fool, I only need a bit more to break free)
Ar - You might have no idea, but this weird place is called a fusion reactor. 
D(anger) - Watcha... talking about...
Ar - Amazingly, it is able to eminate the power of the Sun itself.
Ar - Given your condition, it seems my shocker has nearly run out of power. 
Ar - So, say, do you think you will be able to survive fifty millions degree heat?
D - Enough!
Dimitrius pushed Arron away with a slowly returning power, still oblivious to what was going on around him. 
=fall sound=
Ar(shock) - Behind!
Realizing that Arron indeed saw something behind him, Dimitrius looked around to find a huge cloud of forming plasma spreading through the reactor's coil.
In the same moment Arron disappeared from his previous place.
D(anger) - ...Teleportation?
D - You fool, did you forget who I am?
D - ...
D(anger) - Huh?
D(anger) - Something stops me? 
D(anger) - HOW!?
D(anger) - ARR-
=remove dimitrius sprite=
As the reactor fully powered,  plasma erased his body without a trace.
=future building bg, arron sprite=
Ar - Thanks Iola, that was rather close.
I - N-no problem, we were lucky.
Ri(talk) - Yes, thankfully it worked. 
Ri - His teleportation wasn't that different from the  faeries, only extremely powerf-
=Explosion sound, shaking=
Ar(neutral) - Oh-uh.
Em - What's happening?
Ri(talk) - Rose says the reactor had a leakage, we should run before the building collapses.
Ar(neutral) - Will they be alright?
Ri - Yes, let's go.
=black screen transition, future city background, rose sprite=
Ro(talk) - We made it!
Ro - Look, demons are gone. 
Ri - Yes, with Dimitrius dead the dimensions are no longer connected. 
Ar - Nice work. Time to go home then. 
Em - Huh... Is this place going to stay in our world though?
Ar - Not my problem. 
=black screen transition, village bg, flak sprite=
Ar - Hey, we are back and alive.
F - Nice to see you then, ex-mayor.
Ar(neutral) - ...What do you mean, 'ex-mayor'?
F - Oh, we have elected a new mayor since you were gone and we had no idea if you are even alive.
Ar(shock) - WHAAAT?!
F - There he is by the way.
=Caliban sprite=
Ar - ...Eh? How?
F - Well, he said that he will stop the end of the world if we get him elected. 
C - Oh, Hi Arron. How are you doing?
Ar - ...I'll fucking murder you. 
Ar(shock) - It was me who stopped the end of the world, not him!
G - Yeah, sure, you weren't even around most of the time.
Ar(shock) - I-
Ro(talk) - Master, isn't it fine? We have to return home soon anyway.
Ar(neutral) - ......
Ar(neutral) - Whatever. But how do you plan to do it? Dimitrius is gone now.
I - Umh, I think I've some of those powers, when he died I felt like they went into me. 
I(sad) - Maybe because we were related.
I - I think I'll be able to transfer you back to your world.
F - Well now, don't be so rushy, we surely can celebrate your return before you go.
Ar - ...Thanks.
