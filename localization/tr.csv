"Intro.json_1","The Kingdom of Avior has been at peace for the last few centuries. Political stability felt almost taken for granted not only by citizens but even by royalty. "
"Intro.json_2","Military successes of the previous king, Mizar, provided his family with a big and strong country, which rightfully ruled to this day."
"Intro.json_3","His son and successor, Alcor, reinforced his father's achievements and continued his rulership."
"Intro.json_4","As it happens in a monarchy, his first son, Norbert, prepared to take his place, given his father’s old age."
"Intro.json_5","However, in his twenties, the second prince Arron is nothing but trouble to his family..."
"Intro.json_6","First prince's bedroom"
"Intro.json_7","My Lady, it's a great honor for me to be invited into your bedroom."
"Intro.json_8","Huhu, enough Arron, just come inside already. "
"Intro.json_9","(Jeez, what is master even thinking to go at it again...) "
"Intro.json_10","(Oh, they went in. I better take my position. Sigh...) "
"Intro.json_11","I've been dreaming of this day since our last meeting, and my heart skipped once I'd noticed your beautiful lustful eyes on me this morning..."
"Intro.json_12","You and your flattering again... Gosh, why are you already naked?"
"Intro.json_13","And why aren't you? "
"Intro.json_14","Oh my..."
"Intro.json_15","Few moments later"
"Intro.json_16","(Someone is coming... )"
"Intro.json_17","(It's Prince Norbert!)"
"Intro.json_18","*Knock Knock Knock*"
"Intro.json_19","Arron recognized the signal, his servant, Rose, was instructed to give. "
"Intro.json_20","(Uh-oh... This is bad.)"
"Intro.json_21","My sincerest apologies, my lady."
"Intro.json_22","... Huh?"
"Intro.json_23","The balcony door is stuck? "
"Intro.json_24","Oh, it completely slipped my mind."
"Intro.json_25","Norbert had jammed the door after last time."
"Intro.json_26","......... Shit."
"Intro.json_27","Norbert and a few guards barge into the room. As he sees his naked wife, rage quickly engulfs his face."
"Intro.json_28","Where is he?! "
"Intro.json_29","Dear, what are you doing? I had been taking a nap so nicely. Why have you brought these people into our love nest?"
"Intro.json_30","Check all cabinets, and look under the bed!"
"Intro.json_31","There's nothing under the bed, m'lord. "
"Intro.json_32","Cabinets are empty as well."
"Intro.json_33","Balcony is not opening."
"Intro.json_34","No way! He couldn't have gotten away again, keep looking."
"Intro.json_35","Hmph, if only you were this zealous at nights as you are right now. "
"Intro.json_36","*chuckle*"
"Intro.json_37","What the... "
"Intro.json_38","Behind the door!"
"Intro.json_39","There's nobody here!"
"Intro.json_40","ARRON!!"
"Intro.json_41","..."
"Intro.json_42","I know how it looks, but it wasn't me."
"Intro.json_43","Ouch, stop dragging me, I can walk on my own!"
"Intro.json_44","(Uh-oh.. this didn't go well. I better follow them...)"
"Intro.json_45","Arron, with his hands tied behind his back sits on the floor of a large cell. Norbert observes him, while his subordinates prepare for a ritual."
"Intro.json_46","Rose hides among the shadows of a far corner, unnoticed."
"Intro.json_47","You know, it was funny when you convinced the Pope that Aunt Mary had been possessed by the devil so he brought a whole ceremony for them. "
"Intro.json_48","Everyone knows old people are evil. That's why they still are with us and not with God."
"Intro.json_49","...it also was rather amusing when you brought a bunch of homeless people during negotiations with Reines and insisted that you will become their king in a new nation in our dinning hall. "
"Intro.json_50","Bob could also replace me as a King. "
"Intro.json_51","You are not taking this serious, are you? Tell me, were you really not satisfied with all those palace maids and feudal daughters? Why go after my wife? "
"Intro.json_52","Dunno, you went for her for some reason. You don't know either?"
"Intro.json_53","THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON!? Because she's MY wife?"
"Intro.json_54","Nah, she also seemed quite delighted with my company. I mean, how can you ignore someone who eagerly woos you?"
"Intro.json_55","Shut the hell up, I'm not going to hear from you that my wife is unfaithful. "
"Intro.json_56","Sure, it's all my fault."
"Intro.json_57","Your wildness had been ignored by father way too many times."
"Intro.json_58","Hah. So what you gonna do? You can't kill or imprison me. Everyone will realize you did it, and the people won't like it. "
"Intro.json_59","True. Even though many nobles find your behavior displeasing, killing you isn’t really worth it. You have to disappear."
"Intro.json_60","... What? This is what you are preparing?"
"Intro.json_61","As they kept talking, a number of magical runes across the floor began to glow. "
"Intro.json_62","Yes and we are about to finish. This portal spell will send you where you won't be causing us more troubles ever again. "
"Intro.json_63","Arron's eyes widened with surprise and disbelief."
"Intro.json_64","(Uh, shit, he seems to actually be serious this time.)"
"Intro.json_65","Hey, stop it, Norb, father will know! "
"Intro.json_66","Nobody will know, and nobles will confirm that you just disappeared during the night. Everyone will be happier without you around."
"Intro.json_67","(Oh, no, I have to do something!)"
"Intro.json_68","Farewell, Arron, you were a huge pain in the ass all these years. "
"Intro.json_69","Portal runes shine with incredible brightness when Rose runs out of hiding, trying to push Arron away from it."
"Intro.json_70","Rose? What the... "
"Intro.json_71","Just as she enters the circle, the spell completes, revealing the empty space where once was two people."
"Intro.json_72","Huh... was that his slave? Well, one less witness to worry about. Clean it all up, I'll prepare to make a report for father. "
"Intro.json_73","*Slam*"
"Intro.json_74","In the middle of an empty desert two bodies appear on the ground."
"Intro.json_75","Ouch... Damn it, Rose you are an idiot! "
"Intro.json_76","Ugh. What is this place? Where are we? "
"Intro.json_77","Hell if I know. Untie me already."
"Intro.json_78","Arron barely managed to get up with his hands still tied behind his back."
"Intro.json_79","Rose frees Arron from ropes. "
"Intro.json_80","*Slam* "
"Intro.json_81","Owie... Why!?"
"Intro.json_82","Why? I ask you, why jump in, you moron? In what universe did that seem like a good idea?"
"Intro.json_83","I'm sorry, Master... I just... couldn't hold back."
"Intro.json_84","Forget it. Now what is this place?"
"Intro.json_85","The couple take a long look on their surroundings, finding only desert and rocks. "
"Intro.json_86","Shit, I really shouldn't have slept during those geography lessons."
"Intro.json_87","Norb will really pay for this once I get back."
"Intro.json_88","First I'll have to take care of those suspicious guys with him..."
"Intro.json_89","I think it will be better if we start moving."
"Intro.json_90","Yeah, it doesn’t seem like anyone will be coming to helping us any time soon. Let's go."
"Intro.json_91","Where to? "
"Intro.json_92","Hrm..."
"Intro.json_93","Anywhere! I'm free now, so I can go anywhere I want, Mwahaha!"
"Intro.json_94","(Despite the situation, looks like Master had returned to his normal mood pretty quick. That's a relief...)"
"Intro.json_95","Hmmm... It was midnight when we were at castle, but it’s noon here, that must mean..."
"Intro.json_96","Time travel! "
"Intro.json_97","No, we must be very far away from the kingdom."
"Intro.json_98","Bullshit, you’re telling me time travel isn't real now?"
"Intro.json_99","It never was..."
"Intro.json_100","So I’ll never be able to become my own grandfather? "
"Intro.json_101","...Thankfully."
"Intro 2.json_1","After a days worth of walking, and losing hope, Arron and Rose come across a small, poor settlement."
"Intro 2.json_2","Look, Master, a goblin village!"
"Intro 2.json_3","Looks more like a dunghole to me."
"Intro 2.json_4","We haven't seen any people for 2 days... Let's check it out at least."
"Intro 2.json_5","Fine, whatever."
"Intro 2.json_6","Arron calls for the attention of a single goblin who does not seem surprised by his appearance."
"Intro 2.json_7","Hey you, what place is this? "
"Intro 2.json_8","What does it look like to you? We live here."
"Intro 2.json_9","This place does not look very comfortable to live in. But where is it located? Maybe you can show it on a map?.. If you have one around?"
"Intro 2.json_10","Do I look like I ever went someplace else to care about? Or like I ever seen a map? "
"Intro 2.json_11","..."
"Intro 2.json_12","Yet, you don't look very surprised by us. "
"Intro 2.json_13","A freaking big deal. Adventurers come and go all the time. Some even stay and leech on our food."
"Intro 2.json_14","Curious, and who's domain is this? "
"Intro 2.json_15","Eh? We don't belong to anyone, since nobody really cares about this land. "
"Intro 2.json_16","This place might look like a dump, but it's totally independent. "
"Intro 2.json_17","What? Who governs you then? You don't even have a leader?"
"Intro 2.json_18","No. I told just you that..."
"Intro 2.json_19","Hearing that, Arron's eyes quickly shine with fervor."
"Intro 2.json_20","You heard it? These savages need a governor!"
"Intro 2.json_21","With all respect, I don't think you will be able to lead..."
"Intro 2.json_22","Tell me, friend, do you know the benefits of having someone to organize and take care of town's problems?"
"Intro 2.json_23","A few days later"
"Intro 2.json_24","After becoming the settlement's mayor, Arron and Rose moved into the best available house."
"Intro 2.json_25","See that? And they were saying democracy is a mistake."
"Intro 2.json_26","(Makes me realize why)"
"Intro 2.json_27","I must say, this is a rather nice living space."
"Intro 2.json_28","Oh, and we also have a first visitor today."
"Intro 2.json_29","People want to meet their new leader. Let's not keep them waiting. Bring them in."
"Intro 2.json_30","A shabby looking goblin casually walks in, disinterestedly looking around."
"Intro 2.json_31","Oi, Governor, since you are responsible for the village now, Flak from market asks you to visit him."
"Intro 2.json_32","(No manners at all, huh)"
"Intro 2.json_33","Why he did not visit himself?"
"Intro 2.json_34","He is busy, I guess. Just don't take too long."
"Intro 2.json_35","The goblin disappears, leaving Arron mildly baffled. "
"Intro 2.json_36","You bring him here then. "
"Intro 2.json_37","I'm afraid he won't agree to follow me. We can't order them around just like that. "
"Intro 2.json_38","..."
"Intro 2.json_39","Democracy was a mistake."
"Intro 3.json_1","I've finished asking around."
"Intro 3.json_2","It seems there's no known info about Avior, or where it even might be. "
"Intro 3.json_3","You made sure not to give away where we came from, right? "
"Intro 3.json_4","Yes. Thankfully, there's plenty of adventurers passing by around here, often going anonymous too. "
"Intro 3.json_5","Anyway, these lands are called Vienar. "
"Intro 3.json_6","Never heard of such a name. "
"Intro 3.json_7","Me neither. "
"Intro 3.json_8","Most civilization seems to be run by independent city-states, who seem to trade and share frequently, but mostly oppose each other on political level. "
"Intro 3.json_9","But, our village lies somewhat distant from most other cities, hence why there's little interest in this place."
"Intro 3.json_10","So... that means we can stay here safely?"
"Intro 3.json_11","That also means we have no idea how to get back."
"Intro 3.json_12","Wait, master, are you actually planning to return? "
"Intro 3.json_13","Hm... Maybe."
"Intro 3.json_14","What!? We can't stay here for the rest of our lives. "
"Intro 3.json_15","Why not?"
"Intro 3.json_16","Aren’t you going to miss your family? Your royal life?"
"Intro 3.json_17","Well, I have to get revenge on Norb, don't I."
"Intro 3.json_18","Relax, I'm just kidding. I guess our only option to get back is how we got here. We’re gonna need some skilled mages. "
"Intro 3.json_19","That might prove to be a challenge already. From what passing adventurers said, teleportation magic doesn’t seem to be common around here."
"Intro 3.json_20","Well, all the more reason to make sure our position here is nice and stable."
"Intro 3.json_21","Plus when else am I going to get the chance to rule anyone but mere servants?"
"Market.json_1","Well, this is the only building which doesn't look like it will crash in on us, so it must be here."
"Market.json_2","Hey, anyone around? "
"Market.json_3","Oh, the pink skin mayor guy."
"Market.json_4","Congratulations on winning the elections, I guess."
"Market.json_5","Good thing you dropped by."
"Market.json_6","You don't seem very happy to see me, though."
"Market.json_7","Okay, let me tell you one thing."
"Market.json_8","You might have became a mayor, for how little it counts here."
"Market.json_9","But that doesn't mean anyone will be jumping around you like you are some sort of prince."
"Market.json_10","Sheesh, you got me there."
"Market.json_11","Now, you gonna have to work hard to get anything reasonable done around here."
"Market.json_12","And neither of you look like you are used to working on your own."
"Market.json_13","You can call me Flak and I'm the head of our only worker guild."
"Market.json_14","You pay me, I lend you workers to do whatever you need."
"Market.json_15","Pay you, but not them? This sounds an awful lot like slavery."
"Market.json_16","What a foul word for a young lady."
"Market.json_17","They are not slaves, they are workers. That's different."
"Market.json_18","What is?"
"Market.json_19","The latter sounds better."
"Market.json_20","You have to feed them once in a while or they will stop working."
"Market.json_21","Actually, business wasn't so great recently."
"Market.json_22","You know what? Since you just started here, I'll let you have one worker as a gift."
"Market.json_23","Make sure to make some use of them. Goblins are shitty workers, so don't be shy of using a stick to discipline."
"Market.json_24","(Gulp)"
"Market.json_25","Aren't you a goblin as well? "
"Market.json_26","You bet. Good think I'm not a worker, heh."
"Market 2.json_1","So you have fixed the bridge, huh?"
"Market 2.json_2","I guess you can be of some use after all."
"Market 2.json_3","Now, since that bridge is fixed, you could work out one thing which was bugging me for some time."
"Market 2.json_4","You might have noticed our options for workers are quite low. This wasn't always so."
"Market 2.json_5","Few months ago we also had elves delivered from the east forests. "
"Market 2.json_6","Wow, elves working in such place? Had no idea they do stuff like that. Not from where we came from at least."
"Market 2.json_7","Everyone has to eat, young lady. At more prosperous times there were all sorts of workers here."
"Market 2.json_8","So why do they no longer come here? "
"Market 2.json_9","No clue. I prefer not to stick my nose into their... lifestyle. Maybe you can figure it out."
"Market 2.json_10","Speaking of which, the elves might have some clues for our problem."
"Market 3.json_1","So, you brought elves here."
"Market 3.json_2","Nice to meet you."
"Market 3.json_3","Uh-huh. "
"Market 3.json_4","Well, here's bit of a gold for your hardship. "
"Market 3.json_5","Do note, that you might be able to get different results from using different workers, so make sure to give it a try."
"Market 3.json_6","Are you just making me spend more money on your service?"
"Market 3.json_7","Shut up. I'll charge you extra for them now."
"bridge.json_1","Arron and Rose observe the nearly ruined bridge leading from the village to the other side of the valley."
"bridge.json_2","No matter how you look at it, we can't use this bridge reliably. "
"bridge.json_3","I have complete confidence it would fall under me alone."
"bridge.json_4","Is that so? Maybe you should diet.."
"bridge.json_5","..."
"bridge.json_6","Well, let's make it our first achievement, as this village’s new caretakers."
"bridge.json_7","Wow, the new bridge looks very professional."
"bridge.json_8","I must say this is rather good job, Master."
"bridge.json_9","So you actually can take care of business."
"bridge.json_10","'Actually? So you thought I would be incapable?"
"bridge.json_11","*Sigh* I thought you knew me better than this."
"bridge.json_12","Well... Uh... It's just you acting... the way you are..."
"bridge.json_13","Whatever. I'm leaving."
"bridge.json_14","Wait, Master, please, I'm sorry!"
"ember 1.json_1","There's a new visitor who wants to meet you. Her name is Ember."
"ember 1.json_2","Oho, a new lady? Finally this position begins to pay off. Come on in!"
"ember 1.json_3","*Slam*"
"ember 1.json_4","Dragon girl appears in room"
"ember 1.json_5","Hey!"
"ember 1.json_6","You are the mayor, right?!"
"ember 1.json_7","My name is Ember."
"ember 1.json_8","Shit, Rose, there's a dragon on the loose!"
"ember 1.json_9","Uhm... this is the visitor. "
"ember 1.json_10","Huh... well, at least you’re not a goblin."
"ember 1.json_11","(She's certainly the hottest dragon I've ever seen. Although, for others, it was generally their biology. )"
"ember 1.json_12","Ember payed seemingly no attention to the commentary."
"ember 1.json_13","I'm sorry, am I being too blunt again? Ah-ha, Sorry..."
"ember 1.json_14","Wow, this place is really great! And you look very representative as well!"
"ember 1.json_15","It is, indeed. My skills were recognized by the folk so I was found to be the most suitable ruler."
"ember 1.json_16","Indeed, given you were the only candidate."
"ember 1.json_17","I'll have to penalize you for spilling my trade secrets."
"ember 1.json_18","Anyway, what brought you here? "
"ember 1.json_19","Ah, You see, I'm a blacksmith's..."
"ember 1.json_20","...apprentice."
"ember 1.json_21","It might not sound great, but I was one for a really long time!"
"ember 1.json_22","Since this town has a ruler now, you do need a blacksmith, right?"
"ember 1.json_23","Someone to take care of tools, weapons and armor. Please, let me start a forge here!"
"ember 1.json_24","I'm a bit short on money as of now, but..."
"ember 1.json_25","If you allow me to open my personal shop, I will craft whatever you need as a payment. That's a great deal, right? "
"ember 1.json_26","Does anyone even need a smith shop around here..?"
"ember 1.json_27","A valid point, why here of all places?"
"ember 1.json_28","I'll tell you, but it's a secret, so don't tell anyone, alright? "
"ember 1.json_29","Sure, I'll just force Rose to wear a gag whenever she goes out, to make sure she stays quiet. So?"
"ember 1.json_30","*Frown*"
"ember 1.json_31","Have you seen the competition?"
"ember 1.json_32","Do you realize how much profit I'll be making with no other blacksmiths around? This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop!"
"ember 1.json_33","I might not look like it, but I have studied things about it."
"ember 1.json_34","This is a perfect opportunity to start my own shop!"
"ember 1.json_35","..."
"ember 1.json_36","..."
"ember 1.json_37","This is an impossible request."
"ember 1.json_38","What? But I went such a long way..."
"ember 1.json_39","Ember's eyes began filling with tears."
"ember 1.json_40","No, we can't allow a half-dragon into our town, this would go against safety reg..."
"ember 1.json_41","*Sob*"
"ember 1.json_42","(God, you are not serious now? )"
"ember 1.json_43","What? I can't believe you are so cruel to her. Look, she's crying."
"ember 1.json_44","We can't be driven by woman's emotions in a hefty decisions."
"ember 1.json_45","Hmph, I'm leaving then."
"ember 1.json_46","You can't leave. You were mine to start with!"
"ember 1.json_47","That was in Avior, here I'm free to do what I want. "
"ember 1.json_48","Now, let's go Ember, I'm sure we will find a more friendly place than this."
"ember 1.json_49","Is that so? You'll regret this!"
"ember 1.json_50","..."
"ember 1.json_51","......"
"ember 1.json_52","Being left alone, Arron failed as Mayor and has been exiled by the goblins."
"ember 1.json_53","Fine, I'll allow it. You will have to sign a number of contracts first, though."
"ember 1.json_54","Ember's face quickly changes into image of pure relief."
"ember 1.json_55","You might be wro..."
"ember 1.json_56","That's a great idea! Just sign a couple of contracts and you can start right away."
"ember 1.json_57","Embers eyes shine with happiness"
"ember 1.json_58","Wow, thank you, Arron! I'm so indebted to you for this."
"ember 1.json_59","(What a coincidental use of words.)"
"ember 1.json_60","You won't regret it!"
"ember 1.json_61","So, you gonna need a house for a forge? We might be able to assemble something..."
"ember 1.json_62","Oh, there's no need. I brought my house with me! It's on the hill right outside of town."
"ember 1.json_63","Huh, really. You carried it all by yourself? Half-dragons can do stuff like that? "
"ember 1.json_64","Ha-ha, I've always been carrying stuff around the forge, so I wouldn't get in the way of Master's work. "
"ember 1.json_65","Well, that's the better for us, but I'll have to tax you for taking town's space. "
"ember 1.json_66","Okay!"
"ember 1.json_67","Ember has joined the settlement. Forge is available now."
"ember 2.json_1","I see you found some unusual wood up there. Please, let me have it!"
"ember 2.json_2","Hmh... sure. What's so unusual about it?"
"ember 2.json_3","Oh, I can use it to make items with new properties. "
"ember 2.json_4","You can do that? You are pretty useful after all."
"ember 2.json_5","Ha-ha, You are so kind, Sir Arron! I can also cook scrambled eggs! "
"ember 2.json_6","That's amazing. What are those properties anyway?"
"ember 2.json_7","Depends on the material used, it can make you stronger, faster... stuff like that."
"ember 2.json_8","Ho-h. Can it make my wood stronger? "
"ember 2.json_9","Huh? Your wood? You are not a human?"
"ember 2.json_10","Nah, I'm actually a half-ent. "
"ember 2.json_11","REALLY?!"
"ember 2.json_12","Please, don't trust everything people say."
"ember 2.json_13","But I do have a wood, occasionally, maybe you could help with it."
"ember 2.json_14","I don't quite understand, but sure!"
"ember 2.json_15","He lies to you, he has no lumber. "
"ember 2.json_16","(neutral) Tsk... I've trusted you, Rose. Such a brutish move from you. "
"ember 2.json_17","Uh... I still don't understand, but in either case, if you find any more rare materials, make sure to bring them to me!"
"ember 2.json_18","Aren't I'm one of a kind? "
"ember 2.json_19","Please, stop. "
"ember 3.json_1","Sir Arron, great to see you! What can I help you with?"
"ember 3.json_2","I'm good. Just curious how you are doing."
"ember 3.json_3","Oh, it's great here! And you visit me regularly too. "
"ember 3.json_4","In past people didn't seem to like having me around the village, but you seem so relaxed about it."
"ember 3.json_5","I'm just a dragon's descendant like you."
"ember 3.json_6","What?! REALLY?"
"ember 3.json_7","Maybe. "
"ember 3.json_8","Oh... that might be true, because you are not afraid of me."
"ember 3.json_9","My appearance must be what repulses other people... Do you think I'll be able to find some place where I would be accepted?"
"ember 3.json_10","Hmmm. True, people want to see something similar to them, rather than different. "
"ember 3.json_11","Oh... this makes me sad. "
"ember 3.json_12","But you know what? You might still eventually pass for a human. "
"ember 3.json_13","Oooh? I can? "
"ember 3.json_14","Naturally, you have some human characteristics after all, I'm just not entirely sure how authentic they are."
"ember 3.json_15","Uh... Sorry, I don't understand."
"ember 3.json_16","I'm saying that I'll need to investigate your body to see if you can pass for a human."
"ember 3.json_17","OOOOH, Sir Arron, you can do this for me!? "
"ember 3.json_18","Well if you request it, it's my job to make sure everyone here is happy. "
"ember 3.json_19","Okay, please! Let me just untie my apron."
"ember 3.json_20","(Darn.. this was way too easy, maybe I should later give her a couple of lessons about dignity)"
"ember 3.json_21","So, how is it?"
"ember 3.json_22","Hmmm... Let's see."
"ember 3.json_23","Arron slowly circles around Ember."
"ember 3.json_24","You look rather healthy to me."
"ember 3.json_25","I do? Master always said I heal very fast. "
"ember 3.json_26","He did hit me a lot too, but i didn't feel much, it was kinda funny, ha-ha."
"ember 3.json_27","Is that so..."
"ember 3.json_28","Arron grabbed one of Ember's tits and forcefully rubbed it."
"ember 3.json_29","Ah!"
"ember 3.json_30","Did it hurt?"
"ember 3.json_31","N-no, it was just so sudden..."
"ember 3.json_32","I see, softness seems to be rather good. "
"ember 3.json_33","*Pinch*"
"ember 3.json_34","A-ah!..."
"ember 3.json_35","Hmm sensitivity seems to be good as well..."
"ember 3.json_36","(Darn... I might be enjoying it too much)"
"ember 3.json_37","...Sir Arron? "
"ember 3.json_38","Oh by the way, You don't really need to add 'Sir' for me."
"ember 3.json_39","I don't?.. Ah!"
"ember 3.json_40","Sorry, was it too rough? "
"ember 3.json_41","No, its just... feels weird."
"ember 3.json_42","Mh-m, this is a good sign. Very nice..."
"ember 3.json_43","(Did Master go to Ember’s again? Jeez, he always skips all the boring work...)"
"ember 3.json_44","Hey, Ember, have you seen Ar..."
"ember 3.json_45","..."
"ember 3.json_46","..."
"ember 3.json_47","(What's even going on? They are doing it right here?)"
"ember 3.json_48","(...Wow, Ember's are twice as big as mine)"
"ember 3.json_49","Master, what are you doing?!"
"ember 3.json_50","What's up? Ember just asked me for help."
"ember 3.json_51","(Ember makes move on the Master!? I'd never expect that...)"
"ember 3.json_52","Oh Hey Rose. If you are in no hurry, give us a moment."
"ember 3.json_53","Ah... I'm just... Sorry..."
"ember 3.json_54","Rose quickly shuts the door."
"ember 3.json_55","(No way... She never looked mature like that)"
"ember 3.json_56","Hmm, this is enough I believe. "
"ember 3.json_57","So how is it?"
"ember 3.json_58","This seems passable to me. With some time and work you will surely be able to live with humans nicely."
"ember 3.json_59","Really!? This makes me so happy. Please, help me in the future too, Sir Arron!"
"ember 3.json_60","Gladly."
"Forest 1.json_1","These woods do not seem like they have any civilized life. How exactly do we find elves? "
"Forest 1.json_2","Dunno, maybe we should yell how we are planning to burn down woods?"
"Forest 1.json_3","Please, don't."
"Forest 1.json_4","I'm curious how they are doing here. I've never seen them in life, but back there people said they act very noble and proud."
"Forest 1.json_5","I've seen a couple on the rare meetings. They indeed appear to be snobbish."
"Forest 1.json_6","... "
"Forest 1.json_7","Master, please, don't say that to them in the face."
"Forest 1.json_8","I'm sure they wouldn't like it, and they probably live in much better conditions than we currently are."
"Forest 1.json_9","Hmm... In that case we should conquer them too!"
"Forest 1.json_10","I'll pass. "
"Forest 1.json_11","As if you have a choice."
"Forest 2.json_1","Enough slaughtering of my brethren! What do thou want, fleshling? "
"Forest 2.json_2","Wow, it can talk."
"Forest 2.json_3","Hey, I demand thou not disrespect me! Calling me 'it' assumes thou do not recognize my sentience. "
"Forest 2.json_4","I'm over centuries old and everyone address to me as a male."
"Forest 2.json_5","That's stupid, trees are hermaphrodites. Since when do you even have a society?"
"Forest 2.json_6","Since we moved into this groove. "
"Forest 2.json_7","Oh, yeah, about that, we were told there are elves here. Why are you here instead?"
"Forest 2.json_8","Those elves, thou speak of, hardly live up to the name of elves as I remember them."
"Forest 2.json_9","We have taken them into our custody now and we peacefully coexist."
"Forest 2.json_10","Huh... taken into custody by trees? Whatever, we want them as well, might still be of some use to us. "
"Forest 2.json_11","Thou propose a trade agreement? Of course, we have elves to spare for you and others. Are thou willing to see them?"
"Forest 2.json_12","Sure, why not."
"Forest 2.json_13","*Groan*"
"Forest 2.json_14","Another huge treant slowly comes close. Its trunk bark bends to the sides, revealing a semi-conscious naked figure of an elven girl restricted inside of it. "
"Forest 2.json_15","What the hell? "
"Forest 2.json_16","This is an elf thou were looking for."
"Forest 2.json_17","Why she's like that?!"
"Forest 2.json_18","This way we can protect them and they feed us with their fluids and energy."
"Forest 2.json_19","As in demonstration, thick vine moved through the tied elf's crotch."
"Forest 2.json_20","Mmmhm..."
"Forest 2.json_21","That's enough, you should release her."
"Forest 2.json_22","What? This is not correct..."
"Forest 2.json_23","Rose, pass me the torch."
"Forest 2.json_24","Alright, alright..."
"Forest 2.json_25","In few moments vines have released girl's body, which fell into Arron's arms."
"Forest 2.json_26","Ugh..."
"Forest 2.json_27","What's going on, Willy? "
"Forest 2.json_28","Who's this handsome man holding me? "
"Forest 2.json_29","You see, Erika, this is Arron. He wants to... talk to you."
"Forest 2.json_30","Uh... are you alright?"
"Forest 2.json_31","Just a bit sore, but thanks for worrying, he-he. "
"Forest 2.json_32","Aren't you kept as hostage here...?"
"Forest 2.json_33","Me? No, willies are warm and comfy, and make me feel good! You should try it yourself."
"Forest 2.json_34","... I will pass on that."
"Forest 2.json_35","(I guess we worried for nothing, but what even are these elves then?)"
"Forest 2.json_36","Thee see now, this is completely consensual. We even have papers..."
"Forest 2.json_37","Boring talks again... what a waste of a time."
"Forest 2.json_38","Good to see you aren't snobbish at all, looks like we feared for nothing. "
"Forest 2.json_39","Master!"
"Forest 2.json_40","Oh thank you! You are rather pleasant yourself. "
"Forest 2.json_41","My apologies, do thou want to go to slumber again? "
"Forest 2.json_42","Now when you mention it... Say Arron, right?"
"Forest 2.json_43","I haven't seen anyone like you around here before."
"Forest 2.json_44","I'm certainly an unique being. "
"Forest 2.json_45","Erika moves closer to Arron, taking his hand and giving a sultry look."
"Forest 2.json_46","Can I come along with you? I want to see what's going on in the world and to know you better."
"Forest 2.json_47","*Frown*"
"Forest 2.json_48","With pleasure."
"Forest 2.json_49","Master! Could you at least consider it for a moment before accepting?"
"Forest 2.json_50","Don't be so jealous, sweetheart. I'm not going to keep him to myself."
"Forest 2.json_51","In fact, I'd love to know you better as well!"
"Forest 2.json_52","I refuse!"
"Forest 2.json_53","Ha-ha-ha, you are so modest. That's cute! "
"Forest 2.json_54","Alright, we can continue on the way back, would you mind dressing up before we leave? "
"Forest 2.json_55","Sure thing, honey, give me a moment!"
"Forest 2.json_56","Meanwhile, let's settle what we have came her for. Hey, willow guy..."
"Forest 2.json_57","Ready!"
"Forest 2.json_58","...Really?"
"Forest 2.json_59","Thanks for asking, but I don't like carrying around heavy stuff, so I've got all I need."
"Forest 2.json_60","Looks good to me, let's go. "
"Forest 2.json_61","(...)"
"erika 1.json_1","Well, this place ain't half bad."
"erika 1.json_2","Naturally. I'm the ruler here after all."
"erika 1.json_3","You won't mind me staying here too?"
"erika 1.json_4","I would be honored."
"erika 1.json_5","I mind. We don't really have a room for guests."
"erika 1.json_6","Hmm... That's a shame. Say, Arron, you have a nice, big bed."
"erika 1.json_7","Isn't it a Mayor's responsibility to provide guests with sleeping place? "
"erika 1.json_8","I would love to know you better while you are short on rooms for guests."
"erika 1.json_9","NO!"
"erika 1.json_10","Hm? Why are you against it? "
"erika 1.json_11","Because... Guests shouldn't be bothered by others as they sleep. I can sleep in Master's bed and you take mine."
"erika 1.json_12","Eeeh? But I don't wanna sleep alone."
"erika 1.json_13","Well, if you don't want to get separated from Arron, why don't we all sleep together?"
"erika 1.json_14","(As appealing as it may sound, I'm afraid this might end up in a disaster. Rose seems quite serious about this. )"
"erika 1.json_15","Alright, calm down you two, I believe we have some additional space in the attic."
"erika 1.json_16","Hmm... Fine, but leave your door unlocked. I might want to visit if I get bored."
"erika 1.json_17","Sigh. You are still going at it?"
"rose 1.json_1","(Sigh... After ending up here, I thought at least we could be alone with Master, but now there's Erika and Ember...)"
"rose 1.json_2","(Even though I feel lonely, he ignores, and even mocks me like that.)"
"rose 1.json_3","(Of course he's from royal family and is used to having many women.)"
"rose 1.json_4","(But I can't lose to them after all we went through.)"
"rose 1.json_5","..."
"rose 1.json_6","Rose enters Arron's room, who seems to be already asleep."
"rose 1.json_7","Master..."
"rose 1.json_8","In a few moments she disappear under the blanket."
"rose 1.json_9","Mm... *lick*"
"rose 1.json_10","(Master's scent... being so close drives me crazy.)"
"rose 1.json_11","With only a couple of licks Rose managed to bring Arron to full erection."
"rose 1.json_12","(Already so hard... Seems like he had no other affairs today.)"
"rose 1.json_13","(Alright, then it's all better for me to take care of his needs.)"
"rose 1.json_14","*Slurp*"
"rose 1.json_15","Mmh... "
"rose 1.json_16","*yawn* Hmmm... who might it be here?"
"rose 1.json_17","Oh... This masterful technique can be no other, but my cute pet's."
"rose 1.json_18","Hmp.. *slurp*"
"rose 1.json_19","Giving a blowjob in the middle of the night like that. "
"rose 1.json_20","What a naughty girl."
"rose 1.json_21","But it makes me rather happy. "
"rose 1.json_22","You learned all the right spots."
"rose 1.json_23","Arron affectionately rubbed Rose's head and ears in response to her effort."
"rose 1.json_24","(What am I even thinking, starting it this way...)"
"rose 1.json_25","Rose's left hand unconsciously moved to her drenched pussy."
"rose 1.json_26","Mm... Master, pet me more..."
"rose 1.json_27","You are such a spoiled girl, aren't you."
"rose 1.json_28","Just a little bit more..."
"rose 1.json_29","..."
"rose 1.json_30","Here it comes..."
"rose 1.json_31","...!"
"rose 1.json_32","In last second Rose released Master's penis from her mouth, making it shoot all over her face."
"rose 1.json_33","Ah... Jeez."
"rose 1.json_34","Oh-ho... Still not comfortable with swallowing?"
"rose 1.json_35","Sorry, Master..."
"rose 1.json_36","It's okay. Are you ready to continue?"
"rose 1.json_37","Arron's penis still stood hard despite just coming, much to Rose's relief."
"rose 1.json_38","Rose swiftly moved on top of him."
"rose 1.json_39","Just look how wet you are from merely sucking a dick. "
"rose 1.json_40","I-It's your fault, making me like that..."
"rose 1.json_41","Aha, talking back to your Master? And putting it in without permission as well?"
"rose 1.json_42","Ignoring her Master's mocking, Rose longingly landed on his cock."
"rose 1.json_43","Master... "
"rose 1.json_44","Mhmm, you seem really desperate. Fine, I will excuse it this time."
"rose 1.json_45","This is... because you didn't approach me for so long... Ah!"
"rose 1.json_46","He-he... So my plan has worked."
"rose 1.json_47","Ah... Stupid..."
"rose 1.json_48","Rose was losing herself to pleasure with every move."
"rose 1.json_49","It always surprised her, how different she was acting in contrast with her everyday uptight personality."
"rose 1.json_50","I feel so full..."
"rose 1.json_51","With each movement Rose's gasps grew deeper and deeper."
"rose 1.json_52","Oh, I love your passion..."
"rose 1.json_53","I'm almost there..."
"rose 1.json_54","Ah... Master, please, hug me!"
"rose 1.json_55","Not waiting for a reply, Rose embraced and kissed her Master, as his seed filled her womb. "
"rose 1.json_56","Aaaaaaaaah!"
"rose 1.json_57","..."
"rose 1.json_58","Umh... "
"rose 1.json_59","Ah... I did it again..."
"rose 1.json_60","Good girl. Alight, you can sleep together with me."
"rose 1.json_61","..."
"rose 1.json_62","Rose weakly nodded and buried her face into Arron's chest."
"demitrius 1.json_1","Hmm, what's up with the commotion? "
"demitrius 1.json_2","I'm not sure. Looks like someone popular pays us a visits?"
"demitrius 1.json_3","Hey you, what's going on? "
"demitrius 1.json_4","What, are you some country bumpkin? It's the Ancestral Cult's priest. "
"demitrius 1.json_5","What cult?"
"demitrius 1.json_6","Ancestral Cult. They are the most popular religious group around here. It seems even goblins give them high regards."
"demitrius 1.json_7","I see. Anyway, what's up with the disrespect? Don't you know I'm your mayor?"
"demitrius 1.json_8","Whatever, dumbass. I didn't vote for you. "
"demitrius 1.json_9","That bastard... Rose, we should build a jail. And maybe invent new laws to punish disrespectful folk."
"demitrius 1.json_10","Maybe we should see why this priest came by instead? You know, as your duty as mayor."
"demitrius 1.json_11","Fine. But I refuse to treat him seriously on the inside. "
"demitrius 1.json_12","Maybe you should, given he probably has more authority here than you."
"demitrius 1.json_13","...This is why you should always keep your eyes open and report and suspicious activities."
"demitrius 1.json_14","Hmm? You must be the new ruler of this village. My name is Demitrius. Pleased to meet you."
"demitrius 1.json_15","This is the Mayor, Sir Arron. And my name is Rose. We are pleased to meet you as well."
"demitrius 1.json_16","Hmm? What were you talking about just now?"
"demitrius 1.json_17","This is my mission, to explain to everyone the danger of Demons. Since you had no idea, allow me to repeat myself for you."
"demitrius 1.json_18","(propose a choice: a. Listen obediently, b. Listen disinterestedly both choices lead to same conclusion)"
"demitrius 1.json_19","Despite how peaceful this world might look to you, there's evil beings we call Demons, who always aim to invade and destroy all which is good for us."
"demitrius 1.json_20","Seems nasty. Why would they do this?"
"demitrius 1.json_21","They feed from the world's life energy and since their world has became a barren wasteland, they have been attempting to come here for centuries."
"demitrius 1.json_22","But what do they look like?"
"demitrius 1.json_23","They take many forms, but mostly they disguise as sentient beings. This is why you should be especially careful around any strangers. They might lie how they lost their memory or came from some other world, but our interrogations have shown it all to be lies."
"demitrius 1.json_24","Anyone, looking suspicious or having appeared from nowhere should be reported to Ancestral Cult immediately. We are doing our best to keep the peace. "
"demitrius 1.json_25","*Gulp*"
"demitrius 1.json_26","You are doing God's work, Demitrius, we'll make sure to contact you immediately. "
"demitrius 1.json_27","If that's the only thing you've came for, we can do our best to help you with supplies on your way back."
"demitrius 1.json_28","I'm glad you asked. In fact, I have a cult's mission on my shoulders, I'd be pleased to have your help. "
"demitrius 1.json_29","What could it be?"
"demitrius 1.json_30","There has been a report about an unknown artifact located in nearby caverns. Sometimes such things appear in our world and if it's connected to Demons, it's my job to ensure it's harmless."
"demitrius 1.json_31","As you can see, I'm no fighter, so your escort would be greatly appreciated."
"demitrius 1.json_32","(With all respect, I think it would be best for us to refuse this task.)"
"demitrius 1.json_33","Of course our mayor will gladly help you out, Father. He often skirmishes outside and can handle himself in battle."
"demitrius 1.json_34","... I guess we should've hurried with making those new laws."
"demitrius 1.json_35","I mean, we gladly will help you out, Father Demitrius."
"demitrius 1.json_36","I'm glad to know this village is so highly spirited. Once you prepare, I'll be waiting for you at the exit."
"demitrius 2.json_1","As Dimitrus goes slightly behind the group, Rose talks to the Arron."
"demitrius 2.json_2","We are in a tight spot here. "
"demitrius 2.json_3","If our origin goes public, they will certainly proclaim us to be demons."
"demitrius 2.json_4","Relax, he does not seem to suspect anything."
"demitrius 2.json_5","Once we are done with his task, he's going to leave and it will be all good."
"demitrius 2.json_6","I suppose..."
"demitrius 2.json_7","The villagers do seem to pay him great respect though."
"demitrius 2.json_8","Thankfully, it does not seem like they actually believe in this whole demon idea."
"demitrius 2.json_9","Of course it's all nonsense."
"demitrius 2.json_10","EH? You were listening all this time?"
"demitrius 2.json_11","Don't worry, my lips are shut."
"demitrius 2.json_12","Unless you are interested in my oral skills."
"demitrius 2.json_13","*Sigh* Let's just get this over with."
"demitrius 3.json_1","The team arrives at the dark room room with a small, generic box placed on a ruined altar."
"demitrius 3.json_2","Yes, this seems to be the thing from my reports. "
"demitrius 3.json_3","You have my deep gratitude, Arron. "
"demitrius 3.json_4","It's been a pleasure."
"demitrius 3.json_5","Demitrius approaches and closely inspects the box."
"demitrius 3.json_6","As he removes the lid, a thick fog bursts out and fills the room."
"demitrius 3.json_7","Ah!"
"demitrius 3.json_8","What the..."
"demitrius 3.json_9","Curses!"
"demitrius 3.json_10","*Cough* *Cough*"
"demitrius 3.json_11","Darn it..."
"demitrius 3.json_12","Ugh... What was that..."
"demitrius 3.json_13","Is everyone alright?"
"demitrius 3.json_14","More or less."
"demitrius 3.json_15","Freeze. I know who you are!"
"demitrius 3.json_16","Eh?"
"demitrius 3.json_17","You are not of this world!"
"demitrius 3.json_18","It showed me your demonic nature!"
"demitrius 3.json_19","Uh... Let's calm down. How about we reasonably discuss it?"
"demitrius 3.json_20","You must take me for a fool, if you think you can delude me with your lies."
"demitrius 3.json_21","Surrender now, or face the Ancestor’s Wrath!"
