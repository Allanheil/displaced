The Kingdom of Avior has been at peace for last few centuries. Political stability felt almost granted not only by citizens, but even by royalty. 
Military success of the previous king, Mizar, provided his family a big and strong country, which rightfully ruled by this day.
His son and successor, Alcor, reinforced his father's achievments and continues his ruleship. As it happens in monarchy, his first son, Norbert, prepares to take his place, given Alcor's old age.
Although, King also has a second son, Arron, who's life is immesurably happier than most normal people could ever dream of. However, at his twenties, Arron does not look like anything, but a big trouble to his family...
First prince's bedroom
A - My Lady, it's a great honor for me to be invited into your bedroom.
L - Huhu, enough, Arron, just come inside already. 
R - (Jeez, what master is even thinking going at it again...) 
R - (Oh, they went in. I better take my position. Sigh...) 
A - I've been dreaming of this day since our last meeting, and my heart irked once I've noticed your beautiful lustful eyes on me this morning...
L - You and your flattering again... Gosh, why are you naked already?
A - And why aren't you? 
L - Oh my...
Few moments later
R - (Someone is coming... )
R - (It's a Prince Norbert!)
*Knock Knock Knock*
Arron recognized the signal, Rose was instructed to give. 
A - Uh-oh... This is bad. 
A - My sincirest apologies, My Lady.
A - Huh... The balcony door is stuck? 
L - I completely forgot, Norbert has jammed the door after last time.
A - ......... Shit.
Norbert with couple of guards barges into the room. As he sees his wife naked, rage quickly engulfs his face.
N - Where's he? 
L - Dear, what are you doing? I've been taking a nap so nicely. Why have you brought these people into our love nest?
N - Check all cabinets... and look under the bed!
G - There's no one under the bed, Mi'lord. 
G2 - Cabinets are empty as well.
G3 - Balcony is not openning. 
N - No way! He couldn't have gotten away, search it again.
L - Hmph, if only you were this zealous at nights as you are right now. 
*snort*
N - What the... 
G - Behind the door!
A - It's just a friendly ghost!
N - ARRON!!
A - ...
A - I know how it looks like, but it wasn't me.
A - Ouch, stop dragging me, I can walk on my own!
R - (Oh-uh.. this didn't go well. I better follow them...)
=Scene moves to the prison cellar=
Arron, with hands tied behind his back sits on the floor of large cellar. Norbert observes him, while his subordinates prepare for ritual.
Unspotted, Rose hides among the shadows of far corner.
N - You know, it was funny when you convinced pope that Aunt Mary has been possesed by devil so he brought whole ceremony for the granny. 
A - Everyone knows old people are evil. That's why they still are with us and not with the God.
N - That was honestly amusing when you brought a bunch of homeless people during negotiations with Reines and insisted that you will become their king in a new nation in our dinning hall. 
A - Bob could also replace me as a King. 
N - You are not taking this serious, are you? Tell me, were you really not satisfied with all those palace maids and feudal daughters? Why go after my wife? 
A - Dunno, you went for her for some reason. You don't know either?
N - THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON!? Because she's MY wife?
A - Nah, she also seemed quite delighted with my company. I mean, how can you ignore someone, who's eagerly woos you?
N - Enough, shut the hell up, I'm not going to hear from you that my wife is unfaithful. 
A - Sure, it's all my fault.
N - Your wildness has been ignored by father way too many times, to bring us here.
A - Hah. So what you gonna do? You can't kill or imprison me. Everyone will realize you did it, and people won't like it. 
N - True. Even though many nobles find your behavior displeasing, killing you does not really worth it. You will have to disappear.
A - ... What? This is what you are preparing?
As they kept talking, a number of magical runes across the floor began to glow. 
N - Yes and we are about to finish. This portal spell will send you where you won't be causing us more troubles ever again. 
Arron's eyes widened with surprise and disbelieve.
A - (Uh, shit, he seems to be actually serious this time.)
A - Hey, stop it, Norb, the father will know! 
N - Nobody will know, and nobles will confirm that you just disappered during the night. Everyone will be more happy without you around.
R - (Oh, no, I have to do something!)
N - Farewell, Arron, you were a huge pain in the ass. 
Portal runes shine with increadiable density when Rose runs out of her hiding, trying to push Arron away from it.
A - Rose? What the... 
Just as she enters the circle, the spell completes, revealing the empty space where once was two people.
N - Huh... was it his slave? Well, one less witness to carry about. Clean it all up, I'll prepare to make a report for father. 

*Slam*
In the middle of empty desert two bodies appear on the ground.
A - Ouch... Damn it, Rose you are an idiot! 
R - Owie. What's this place? Where are we? 
A - Hell if I know. Untie me already.
Arron barely managed to get up with his hands still tied behind his back.
*Rose frees Arron from ropes*
*Slam* 
R - Owie... Why!?
A - Why? I ask you, why jump in, you moron? In what universe that seemed like a good idea?
R - I'm sorry, Master... I just... couldn't hold back.
A - Forget it. Now what is this place? Shit, I really shouldn't have sleept during those geography lessons.
A - Norb will really pay for this once I get back. Firstly I'll take care of those suspicious guys with him...
R - I think it will be better if we start moving.
A - Yeah, it does not seem like anyone will be serving us any time soon. Let's go.
R - Where to? 
A - Hrm.. Anywhere! I'm free now, so I can go anywhere I want, Mwahaha!
R - (Despite the situtation, looks like Master has returned to his normal mood really quickly. That's a reflief...)
Blackout

R - Hmmm... It was midnight when we were at castle, but its a noon here, that must mean...
A - A timetravel! 
R - No, this land must be very far away from Kingdom.
A - Bullshit, you telling me timetravel isn't real now?
R - It never was...
A - So I will never be able to become my own grandfather? 
R - ...Thankfully
